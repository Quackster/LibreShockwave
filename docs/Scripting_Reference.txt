CHAPTER 1 

Introduction 


This reference provides conceptual and how-to information about scripting in Macromedia 
Director MX 2004, and also provides reference descriptions and examples for the scripting 
application programming interfaces (APIs) that you use to write scripts. 

The scripting APIs are the means by which you access the functionality of Director through 
script to add interactivity to a movie. By using these APIs, you can create interactive functionality 
that is identical to that provided by the prewritten behaviors that are shipped with Director, in 
addition to functionality that is more powerful and more varied than that provided by the 
prewritten behaviors. 

The prewritten behaviors enable you to add basic interactive functionality to a movie, such as 
moving the playhead to a frame number or marker, or zooming in when a user clicks a sprite. 
They also enable non-interactive functionality such as sprite animation, media loading, and frame 
navigation. The scripting APIs enable you to extend and customize these types of functionality. 

Intended audience 

This reference is intended for you if you want to do any of the following: 

• Extend the existing functionality of prewritten behaviors by using script. 

• Add functionality to a movie by using script instead of prewritten behaviors. 

• Add more powerful, varied, and custom functionality to a movie than that provided by 
prewritten behaviors. 

This reference is intended to provide all the information, from basic to advanced, you need to add 
interactivity to your movies by using script. Therefore, you do not need to have any prior 
scripting experience to write effective scripts in Director. 

Regardless of your experience level with Director, Lingo, or JavaScript syntax, take a few moments 
to browse Chapter 2, “Director Scripting Essentials,” on page 9 and Chapter 3, “Writing Scripts 
in Director,” on page 49 before you begin writing scripts. Like any product, Director has its own 
unique set of scripting conventions, types of data, and so on. You will need to be comfortable 
with these unique characteristics of Director before you can write effective scripts.

What’s new with Director scripting 

If you have written scripts in previous versions of Director, you should note some new and 
important changes about scripting in this latest release. 

Dot syntax scripting format 

In previous releases of Director, you could write Lingo scripts by using two types of syntax: 
verbose syntax or dot syntax. Verbose syntax was very similar to English, and was relatively easy 
for new programmers to learn. However, verbose syntax scripts quickly became long and complex, 
and were difficult to debug. 

Now that the scripting model of Director is compatible with both Lingo and JavaScript syntax, 
scripts should be written only in dot syntax. Dot syntax will be familiar to many programmers, 
since it is the syntax used in most object-oriented languages such as Java or C++, and in many 
web-based scripting languages such as Microsoft JScript or JavaScript. 

To support backwards compatibility, scripts written by using verbose syntax in previous versions 
of Director will still run. However, starting with Director MX 2004, dot syntax is the 
recommended syntax to use, and is the only syntax that will be supported and documented in 
the future. 

For more information on using dot syntax to write scripts, see “Scripting in dot syntax format” 
on page 50. 

JavaScript syntax compatibility 

Director is now compatible with JavaScript syntax. This means that in addition to being able to 
author and debug scripts by using Lingo, which is the long-time scripting language of Director, 
you can choose to author and debug scripts by using JavaScript syntax. The implementation of 
JavaScript in Director is referred to as JavaScript syntax throughout this reference. 

The support of JavaScript syntax in Director helps create a scripting environment that is familiar 
not only to JavaScript developers but also to developers experienced with Macromedia Flash 
ActionScript, Macromedia Flash Communication Server, Macromedia Dreamweaver, 
Macromedia Authorware, and a number of other environments. 

The implementation of JavaScript syntax in Director is JavaScript 1.5, which means that it is fully 
compliant with the ECMAScript Language Specification ECMA-262, 3rd Edition. Almost all of 
the features and functionality in JavaScript 1.5 are now available in Director. 

For more information on choosing Lingo or JavaScript syntax, see “Choosing between Lingo and 
JavaScript syntax” on page 49. 

Note: This reference is intended to only discuss the features and functionality of the JavaScript 1.5 
implementation that are essential to writing JavaScript syntax scripts in Director. It is not intended to 
provide a complete reference for JavaScript 1.5. For more detailed information on JavaScript 1.5 than 
is provided in this reference, see one of the many third-party resources on the subject. 

New ways to access the scripting APIs 

In this release of Director, the scripting APIs have been grouped into objects, and are accessed 
through these objects. These objects contain the functionality required to add interactivity to 
your movies and are accessible to both Lingo and JavaScript syntax within Director, projectors, 
and Macromedia Shockwave Player.

Chapter 1: Introduction 



Although the way you access the scripting APIs in this release may vary from previous releases, 
you still have access to the same APIs that you did before, in addition to some brand new ones. 
The only difference is that you access them by using the new objects. 

For more information on the objects and their corresponding scripting APIs, see “Introducing the 
Director objects” on page 51. 

What’s new in this documentation 

If you learned how to script in previous versions of Director, you should know about some 
changes in the scripting documentation for this release. The Director Scripting Reference takes the 
place of the Lingo Dictionary that was shipped with previous versions of Director. This reference is 
organized differently than the Lingo Dictionary. 

In the Lingo Dictionary, information about the scripting model was organized by feature. 

For example, if you wanted to learn how to work with sprites in script, you looked up that 
information in one of the sections under the Sprites heading, such as Dragging Sprites, Sprite 
Dimensions, and so on. In addition, all of the scripting APIs were listed in a single alphabetical 
list, which meant that all functions, properties, events, and so on were mixed together 
alphabetically. 

In the Director Scripting Reference, information about the scripting model is organized by object. 
This organization closely reflects the organization of the actual scripting objects that you use in 
your scripts. For example, if you want to find out how to work with sprites in script, you should 
look for the Sprite section in the chapter, Director Core Objects. 

The scripting APIs are still listed in alphabetical order, but they are categorized by API type. For 
example, all methods are listed alphabetically under the Methods heading, all properties are listed 
alphabetically under the Properties heading, and so on. 

Finding information about scripting in Director 

With its new organization, the Director Scripting Reference contains the following topics: 

Director Scripting Essentials Provides information about the basic scripting concepts and 
components you will use when scripting in Director. 

Writing Scripts in Director Provides information about the Director scripting environment in 
addition to advanced scripting concepts and techniques. 

Debugging Scripts in Director Provides information about how to find problems in your 
scripts when they are not performing as expected. 

Director Core Objects Provides a list of the objects and APIs that you use to access the core 
functionality and features in Director, such as the Director player engine, movie windows, sprites, 
sounds, and so on. 

Media Types Provides a list of the media types and APIs that you use to access the functionality 
of the various media types in Director, such as RealMedia, DVD, Animated GIF, and so on, that 
are added to movies as cast members. 

Scripting Objects Provides a list of the scripting objects, also known as Xtra extensions, and 
APIs that you use to extend core Director functionality. Xtra extensions provide capabilities such 
as importing filters and connecting to the Internet. 

3D Objects Provides a list of the objects you use to add 3D functionality to a movie.

CHAPTER 2 

Director Scripting Essentials 


If you are new to scripting in Macromedia Director MX 2004, you may want to take some time 
to learn the basic scripting concepts that are essential to understanding how to script in Director 
before you begin. Some of these essentials include definitions of important terms, syntax rules, 
available data types, and information about the basic elements of scripting in Director—for 
example, variables, arrays, operators, and so on. 

Types of scripts 

A Director movie can contain four types of scripts: behaviors, movie scripts, parent scripts, and 
scripts attached to cast members. Behaviors, movie scripts, and parent scripts all appear as 
independent cast members in the Cast window. A script attached to a cast member is associated 
with that cast member in the Cast window and does not appear independently. 

• Behaviors are scripts that are attached to sprites or frames in the Score, and are referred to as 
sprite behaviors or frame behaviors. The Cast window thumbnail for each behavior contains a 
behavior icon in the lower right corner. 

When used in the Director Scripting Reference, the term behavior refers to any script that you 
attach to a sprite or a frame. This differs from the behaviors that come in the Director Library 
Palette. For more information on these behaviors, which are built into Director, see the Using 
Director topics in the Director Help Panel. 

All behaviors that have been added to a cast library appear in the Behavior inspector’s Behavior 
pop-up menu. Other types of scripts do not appear there. 

You can attach the same behavior to more than one location in the Score. When you edit a 
behavior, the edited version is applied everywhere the behavior is attached in the Score. 

• Movie scripts contain handlers that are available globally, or on a movie level. Event handlers in 
a movie script can be called from other scripts in the movie as the movie plays. 

A movie script icon appears in the lower right corner of the movie script’s Cast window 
thumbnail. 

Movie scripts are available to the entire movie, regardless of which frame the movie is in or 
which sprites the user is interacting with. When a movie plays in a window or as a linked 
movie, a movie script is available only to its own movie. 


9 



• Parent scripts are special scripts that contain Lingo that is used to create child objects. You can 
use parent scripts to generate script objects that behave and respond similarly yet can still 
operate independently of each other. A parent script icon appears in the lower right corner of 
the Cast window thumbnail. 

For information on using parent scripts and child objects, see “Object-oriented programming 
with Lingo” on page 55. 

JavaScript syntax does not use parent scripts or child objects; it uses regular JavaScript syntax- 
style object-oriented programming techniques. For information on object-oriented 
programming in JavaScript syntax, see “Object-oriented programming with JavaScript syntax” 
on page 65 

• Scripts attached to cast members are attached directly to a cast member, independent of the 
Score. Whenever the cast member is assigned to a sprite, the cast member’s script is available. 
Unlike behaviors, movie scripts, and parent scripts, cast member scripts do not appear in the 
Cast window. Fdowever, if Show Cast Member Script Icons is selected in the Cast Window 
Preferences dialog box, cast members that have a script attached display a small script icon in 
the lower left corner of their thumbnails in the Cast window.

Scripting terminology 

Both Lingo and JavaScript syntax use some terms that are specific to each language, in addition to 
some terms that are shared between each language. 

Important scripting terms are listed here in alphabetical order. These terms are used throughout 
the Director Scripting Reference, so it will help to understand these terms before moving forward. 

• Constants are elements whose values do not change. For example, in Lingo, constants such as 
TAB, EMPTY, and RETURN always have the same values, and cannot be modified. In JavaScript 
syntax, constants such as Math . PI and Number. MAX_VALUE always have the same values, and 
cannot be modified. You can also create your own custom constants in JavaScript syntax by 
using the keyword const. 

For more information on constants, see “Constants” on page 20. 

• Events are actions that occur while a movie is playing. Events occur when a movie stops, a 
sprite starts, the playhead enters a frame, the user types at the keyboard, and so on. All events 
in Director are predefined, and always have the same meaning. 

For more information on events, see “Events” on page 33. 

• Expressions are any part of a statement that produces a value. For example, 2 + 2 is 
an expression. 

• Functions refer to either top-level functions or specific types of JavaScript syntax code. 

A top-level function instructs a movie to do something while the movie is playing or returns a 
value, but it is not called from any specific object. For example, you would call the top-level 
1 i st () function by using the syntax 1 i st (). Like a function, a method also instructs a movie 
to do something while the movie is playing or returns a value, but it is always called from 
an object. 

A function is used in JavaScript syntax to represent an event handler, a custom object, a custom 
method, and so on. The use of JavaScript functions in these cases is described in the applicable 
topics later in this reference. 


10 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 





• Handlers, or event handlers, are sets of statements within a script that run in response to a 
specific event and subsequent message. When an event occurs, Director generates and sends 
a corresponding message to scripts, and a corresponding handler runs in response to the 
message. The names of handlers are always the same as the events and messages they 
respond to. 

Note: Although in JavaScript syntax an event is actually handled by a function, the term handler is 
used generically throughout this reference to refer to both Lingo handlers and JavaScript syntax 
functions that handle events. 

For more information on handlers, see “Handlers” on page 35. 

• Keywords are reserved words that have a special meaning. For example, in Lingo, the keyword 
end indicates the end of a handler. In JavaScript syntax, the keyword var indicates that the 
term following it is a variable. 

• Lists (Lingo) or Arrays (JavaScript syntax) are ordered sets of values used to track and update 
an array of data, such as a series of names or the values assigned to a set of variables. A simple 
example is a list of numbers such as [ 1, 4 , 2 ]. 

For more information on using lists in both Lingo and JavaScript syntax, see “Linear lists and 
property lists” on page 38. 

For more information on using JavaScript syntax arrays, see “JavaScript syntax arrays” 
on page 45. 

• Messages are notices that Director sends to scripts when specific events occur in a movie. For 
example, when the playhead enters a specific frame, the enterFrame event occurs and 
Directors sends an enterFrame message. If a script contains an enterFrame handler, the 
statements within that handler will run, because the handler received the enterFrame message. 
If no scripts contain a handler for a message, the message is ignored in script. 

For more information on messages, see “Messages” on page 34 

• Methods are terms that either instruct a movie to do something while the movie is playing or 
return a value, and are called from an object. For example, you would call the insertFrameO 
method from the Movie object, using the syntax _movi e.insertFrameO. Although similar in 
functionality to top-level functions, methods are always called from an object, and top-level 
functions are not. 

• Operators are terms that calculate a new value from one or more values. For example, the 
addition (+) operator adds two or more values together to produce a new value. 

For more information on operators, see “Operators” on page 25. 

• Parameters are placeholders that let you pass values to scripts. Parameters only apply to 
methods and event handlers, and not to properties. They are required by some methods and 
optional for others. 

For example, the Movie object’s go () method sends the playhead to specific frame, and 
optionally specifies the name of the movie that frame is in. To perform this task, the g o () 
method requires at least one parameter, and allows for a second parameter. The first required 
parameter specifies what frame to send the playhead to, and the second optional parameter 
specifies what movie the frame is in. Because the first parameter is required, a script error will 
result if it is not present when the go () method is called. Because the second parameter is 
optional, the method will perform its task even if the parameter is not present. 


Scripting terminology 11 



• Properties are attributes that define an object. For example, a sprite in a movie has specific 
attributes, such as how wide it is, how tall it is, its background color, and so on. To access the 
values of these three specific attributes, you would use the Sprite object’s wi dth, he i ght, and 
backColor properties. 

For more information on assigning properties to variables, see “Storing and updating values in 
variables” on page 21. 

• Statements are valid instructions that Director can execute. All scripts are made up of sets of 
statements. The following Lingo is a single complete statement. 

_movie.got"Author") 

For more information on writing script statements, see “Scripting in dot syntax format” 
on page 50 

• Variables are elements used to store and update values. Variables must start with a letter, an 
underscore (_), or the dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters in a variable name can also be 
digits (0-9). To assign values to variables or change the values of many properties, you use the 
equals (=) operator. 

For more information on using variables, see “Variables” on page 21. 

Scripting syntax 

The following are general syntax rules that apply to Lingo and JavaScript syntax. 

• Comment markers vary between Lingo and JavaScript syntax. 

All Lingo comments are preceded by double hyphens (- -). Each line of a comment that covers 
multiple lines must be preceded by double hyphens. 

-- This is a single-line Lingo comment 

- - This is a 

-- multiple-line Lingo comment 

JavaScript syntax comments on a single line are preceded by a double-slash (//). Comments 
that cover multiple lines are preceded with a /* and followed by a */. 

// This is a single-line JavaScript syntax comment 

/* This is a 

multiple-line JavaScript syntax comment */ 

You can place a comment on its own line or after any statement. Any text following the 
comment markers on the same line are ignored. 

Comments can consist of anything you want, such as notes about a particular script or handler 
or notes about a statement whose purpose might not be obvious. Comments make it easier for 
you or someone else to understand a procedure after you’ve been away from it for a while. 
Adding large numbers of comments does not increase the size of your movie file when it is 
saved as a compressed DCR or DXR file. Comments are removed from the file during the 
compression process. 

Comment markers can also be used to ignore sections of code you want to deactivate for 
testing or debugging purposes. By adding comment markers rather than removing the code, 
you can temporarily turn it into comments. Select the code you want to turn on or off, and 
then use the Comment or Uncomment buttons in the Script window to quickly add or remove 
comment markers. 


12 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



• Parentheses are required after all method and function names. For example, when calling the 
Sound object’s beep( ) method, you must include the parentheses after the word beep. 
Otherwise, a script error will occur. 

// JavaScript syntax 

_sound.beep(); // this statement will work properly 

_sound.beep; // this statement will result in a script error 

When you call a method, function, or handler from within another method, function, or 
handler, you must include parentheses in the calling statement. In the following example, the 
modi fySpri te( ) method contains a call toaspriteClicked handler. The call to the 
spri teCl i eked handler must include parentheses; otherwise, a script error occurs. 

// JavaScript syntax 
function modifySprite() { 

spriteClicked(); // this call to the handler will work properly 
spriteClieked; // this call to the handler results in a script error 

1 

function spriteClicked() { 

// handler code here 

1 


You can also use parentheses to override the order of precedence in math operations, or to 
make your statements easier to read. For example, the first math expression below yields a 
result of 13, while the second expression yields a result of 5: 

5*3-2-- yields 13 
5 * (3 - 2) -- yields 5 

• Event handler syntax varies between Lingo and JavaScript syntax. In Lingo, handlers use the 
syntax on hand 1 erName. In JavaScript syntax, handlers are implemented as functions, and use 
the syntax functi on hand!erNamei ). For example, the following statements comprise a 
handler that plays a beep when the mouse button is clicked: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown 
_sound.beep() 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDown!) { 

_sound.beep!); 


• Event handler parameter syntax can vary between Lingo and JavaScript syntax. Both Lingo and 
JavaScript syntax support enclosing parameters passed to a handler within parentheses. If more 
than one parameter is passed, each parameter is separated by a comma. In Lingo, you can also 
pass parameters that are not enclosed by parentheses. For example, the following addThem 
handler receives the two parameters a and b. 

-- Lingo syntax 

on addThem a, b -- without parentheses 
c = a + b 
end 

on addThem(a, b) -- with parentheses 
c = a + b 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function addThem(a, b) { 
c = a + b; 


Scripting syntax 13 



• The const keyword can be used in JavaScript syntax to specify a constant whose value does not 
change. Lingo has its own predefined set of constants (TAB, EMPTY, and so on); therefore, the 
keyword const does not apply to Lingo. 

For example, the following statement specifies a constant named i ntAuthors and sets its value 
to 12. This value will always be 12, and cannot be changed through script. 

// JavaScript syntax 
const intAuthors = 12; 

• The va r keyword in JavaScript syntax can be placed in front of a term to specify that the term 
is a variable. The following statement creates a variable named startValue. 

// JavaScript syntax 
var startValue = 0; 

Note: Although using var in JavaScript syntax is optional, it is recommended that you always 
declare local JavaScript syntax variables, or those inside a function, using var. For more 
information on using variables, see “Variables” on page 21. 

• The line continuation symbol (\) in Lingo indicates that a long line of sample code has been 
broken into two or more lines. Lines of Lingo that are broken in this way are not separate lines 
of code. For example, the following code would still run. 

-- Lingo syntax 

tTexture = member("3D").model("box") \ 

.shader.texture 

JavaScript syntax does not include a line continuation symbol. To break multiple lines of 
JavaScript syntax code, add a carriage return at the end of a line, and then continue the code on 
the following line. 

• Semicolons can be used to specify the end of a statement of JavaScript syntax code. Semicolons 
do not apply to Lingo. 

Using a semicolon is optional. If used, it is placed at the end of a complete statement. For 
example, both of the following statements create a variable named startValue. 

// JavaScript syntax 
var startValue = 0 
var startValue = 0; 

A semicolon does not necessarily specify the end of a line of JavaScript syntax code, and 
multiple statements can be placed on one line. However, placing separate statements on 
separate lines is recommended in order to improve readability. For example, the following 
three statements occupy only one line of code and function properly, but it is difficult to 
read the code. 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.go("Author"); var startValue = 0; _sound.beep(); 

• Character spaces within expressions and statements are ignored in both Lingo and JavaScript 
syntax. In strings of characters surrounded by quotation marks, spaces are treated as characters. 
If you want spaces in a string, you must insert them explicitly. For example, the first statement 
below ignores the spaces between the list items, and the second statement includes the spaces. 
-- Lingo syntax 

myListl = ["1", "2", "3"] -- yields ["1", "2", "3"] 

myList2 = [" 1 " 2 " 3 yields [" 1 " 2 " 3 "] 


14 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



• Case-sensitivity can vary between Lingo and JavaScript syntax. 

Lingo is not case-sensitive in any circumstance—you can use uppercase and lowercase letters 
however you want. For example, the following four statements are equivalent: 

-- Lingo syntax 
member("Cat").hi 1 ite = true 
member!"cat").hi Lite = True 
MEMBER!"CAT").HI LITE = TRUE 
Member! "Cat"). Eli 1 i te = true 

Although Lingo is not case-sensitive, it’s a good habit to choose a case convention and use it 
consistently throughout your scripts. This makes it is easier to identify names of handlers, 
variables, cast members, and so on. 

JavaScript syntax is case-sensitive when referring to objects, the top level properties or methods 
that refer to objects, or when referring to user-defined variables. For example, the top level 
sprite!) method returns a reference to a specific Sprite object, and is implemented in 
Director with all lowercase letters. The first statement below refers to the name of the first 
sprite in a movie, while the second and third statements result in a script error. 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite!1).name // This statement functions normally 
Sprite(1).name // This statement results in a script error 
SPRITE!1).name // This statement results in a script error 

Literal strings are always case-sensitive in both Lingo and JavaScript syntax. 

For more information on using strings, see “Strings” on page 18. 


Data types 

A data type is a set of data with values that have similar, predefined characteristics. Every variable 
and property value in Director is of a specific data type, and values returned by methods are of a 
specific data type. 

For example, consider the following two statements. In the first statement, variable i ntX is 
assigned a whole number value of 14, which is an integer. So, the data type of variable i ntX is 
integer. In the second statement, variable stri ngX is assigned a sequence of character values, 
which is a string. So, the data type of variable stri ngX is string. 

-- Lingo syntax 
intX = 14 

stringX = "News Headlines" 

// JavaScript syntax 
var intX = 14; 

var stringX = "News Headlines"; 

The values that are returned by methods or functions are also of an inherent data type. For 
example, the Player object’s windowPresent!) method returns a value that specifies whether a 
window is present. The returned value is TRUE (1) or FALSE (0). 


Data types 15 




Some data types are shared between Lingo and JavaScript syntax, and some data types are specific 
to one language or another. The set of data types that Director supports is fixed and cannot be 
modified, meaning that new data types cannot be added and existing data types cannot be 
removed. Director supports the following data types. 


Data type Description 


# (symbol) 
Array 

Boolean 


Color 

Constant 

Date 

Float 

Function 

Integer 

List 

Math 

null 

Number 

Object 


A self-contained unit that can be used to represent a condition or flag. For example, 

#1 ist or #word. 

(JavaScript syntax only) Although not literally a data type, an Array object can be 
used to work with linear lists of values. The functionality of an Array object is similar 
to that of the List data type in Lingo. 

A value that is TRUE (1) or FALSE (0). In Lingo, all TRUE or FALSE values are simple 
integer constants, 1 for TRUE, 0 for FALSE. In JavaScript syntax, all true or fal se 
values are by default the actual Boolean true or fal se values, but are converted to 
simple integer constants automatically when required in Director. 

In Lingo, TRUE and FALSE can be either lowercase or uppercase. In JavaScript 
syntax, true and fal se must always be lowercase. 

Represents an object’s color. 

A piece of data whose value does not change. 

Although not literally a data type, in JavaScript syntax a Date object can be used to 
work with dates. In Lingo, use the date() method to create a Date object and work 
with dates. 

(Lingo only) A floating-point number. For example, 2.345 or 45.43. 

(JavaScript syntax only) Although not literally a data type, a Function object can be 
used to specify a string of code to run. 

(Lingo only) A whole number. For example, 5 or 298. 

A linear or property list made up of values or property names and values, 
respectively. 

(JavaScript syntax only) Although not literally a data type, a Math object can be 
used to perform mathematical functions. 

(JavaScript syntax only) Denotes a variable whose value behaves as 0 in numeric 
contexts and as FALSE in Boolean contexts. 

(JavaScript syntax only) Although not literally a data type, a Number object can be 
used to represent numerical constants, such as a maximum value, not-a-number 
(NaN), and infinity. 

Although not literally a data type, an Object object can be used to create a custom 
named container that contains data and methods that act on that data. 


Point A point on the Stage that has both a horizontal and vertical coordinate. 

Rect A rectangle on the Stage. 

RegExp (JavaScript only) A regular expression pattern that is used to match character 

combinations in strings. 

String A contiguous sequence of keyboard symbols or character values. For example, 

"Director" or "$5.00". 


16 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



Data type Description 

undefined (JavaScript syntax only) Denotes a variable that does not have a value. 

Vector A point in 3D space. 

VOID (Lingo only) Denotes an empty value. 


Note: Many of the data types and objects that are specific to JavaScript syntax contain their own set 
of methods and properties that can be used to further manipulate those types. While the Director 
Scripting Reference may refer to some of these methods and properties, it does not include complete 
reference information about them. For more detailed information on these data types and objects, 
and their methods and properties, see one of the many third-party resources on the subject. 

The built-in properties in Director, such as the Cast object’s name property, can only be assigned 
values that are the same data type as that of the property’s inherent data type. For example, the 
Cast object’s name property’s inherent data type is a string, so the value must be a string such as 
News Headl i nes. If you try to assign a value of a different data type to this property, such as the 
integer 20, a script error occurs. 

If you create your own custom properties, their values can be of any data type, regardless of the 
data type of the initial value. 

Both Lingo and JavaScript syntax are dynamically typed. This means that you do not have to 
specify the data type of a variable when you declare it, and data types are automatically converted 
as needed while a script runs. 

For example, the following JavaScript syntax initially sets the variable myMovi e to an integer, and 
later in the script it is set to a string. When the script runs, the date type of myMovi e is converted 
automatically. 

-- Lingo syntax 

myMovie = 15 -- myMovie is initially set to an integer 
myMovie = "Animations" -- myMovie is later set to a string 
// JavaScript syntax 

var myMovie = 15; // myMovie is initially set to an integer 
myMovie = "Animations"; // myMovie is later set to a string 


Data types 17 



Literal values 


A literal value is any part of a statement or expression that is to be used exactly as it is, rather than 
as a variable or a script element. Literal values that you encounter in script are character strings, 
integers, decimal numbers, cast member names and numbers, frame and movie names and 
numbers, symbols, and constants. 

Each type of literal value has its own rules. 

Strings 

Strings are words or groups of characters that script treats as regular words instead of as variables. 
Strings must be enclosed in double quotation marks. For example, you might use strings to give 
messages to the user of your movie or to name cast members. In the following statement, Hello 
and Greeting are both strings. Hel 1 o is the literal text being put into the text cast member; 
Greeting is the name of the cast member. 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"Greeting").text = "Hello" 

Similarly, if you test a string, double quotation marks must surround each string, as in the 
following example: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if "Hello Mr. Jones" contains "Hello" then soundHandler 

Both Lingo and JavaScript syntax treat spaces at the beginning or end of a string as a literal part of 
the string. The following expression includes a space after the word to: 

// JavaScript syntax 

trace!"My thoughts amount to "); 

Although Lingo does not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase when referring to cast 
members, variables, and so on, literal strings are case-sensitive. For example, the following two 
statements place different text into the specified cast member, because Hello and HELLO are 
literal strings. 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"Greeting").text = "Hello" 
member!"Greeting").text = "HELLO" 

In Lingo, the string!) function can convert a numerical value into a string. In JavaScript syntax, 
the toStri ng( ) method can convert a numerical value into a string. 

Note: Attempting to use the toStri ng () method in JavaScript syntax on a nul 1 or undefi ned value 
results in a script error. This is in contrast with Lingo, in which the string!) function works on all 
values, including those that are VOID. 

Numbers 

In Lingo, there are two types of numbers: integers and decimals. 

An integer is a whole number, without any fractions or decimal places, in the range of 
-2,147,483,648 and +2,147,483,647. Enter integers without using commas. Use a minus (-) sign 
for negative numbers. 


18 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



A decimal number, also called a floating-point number, or float, is any number that includes a 
decimal point. In Lingo, the f 1 oatPreci si on property controls the number of decimal places 
used to display these numbers. Director always uses the complete number, up to 15 significant 
digits, in calculations; Director rounds any number with more than 15 significant digits in 
calculations. 

JavaScript syntax does not distinguish between integers and floating-point numbers, and merely 
uses numbers. For example, the following statements illustrate that the number 1 is an integer in 
Lingo and a number in JavaScript syntax, and that the decimal number 1.05 is a float in Lingo 
and a number in JavaScript syntax: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(ilk(l)) -- ((integer 
put(i1k(1.05)) -- ((float 

// JavaScript syntax 
traceltypeof(1)) // number 
trace!typeof!1.05)) // number 

In Lingo, you can convert a decimal to an integer by using the integer!) function. You can 
also convert an integer to a decimal by performing a mathematical operation on the integer, for 
example, by multiplying an integer by a decimal. In JavaScript syntax, you can convert a string or 
a decimal number to a whole number by using the pa rse I nt () function. As opposed to Lingo’s 
integer!) function, pa rse I nt! ) rounds down. For example, the following statement rounds 
off the decimal number 3.9 and converts it to the integer 4 (Lingo) and the number 3 
(JavaScript syntax). 

-- Lingo syntax 

theNumber = integer(3.9) -- results in a value of 4 
// JavaScript syntax 

var theNumber = parselnt(3.9); // results in a value of 3 
In Lingo, the val ue( ) function can convert a string into a numerical value. 

You can also use exponential notation with decimal numbers: for example, -1.1234e-100 or 
123.4e+9. 

In Lingo, you can convert an integer or string to a decimal number by using the f 1 oat () 
function. In JavaScript syntax, you can convert a string to a decimal number by using the 
parseFl oat! ) function. For example, the following statement stores the value 3.0000 (Lingo) 
and 3 (JavaScript syntax) in the variable theNumber. 

-- Lingo syntax 

theNumber = f1 oat(3) -- results in a value of 3.0000 
// JavaScript syntax 

var theNumber = parseFloat(3) // results in a value of 3 


Literal values 19 



Constants 

A constant is a named value whose content never changes. 

In Lingo, the predefined terms TRUE, FALSE, VOID, and EMPTY are constants because their values 
are always the same. The predefined terms BACKSPACE, ENTER, QUOTE, RETURN, SPACE, and TAB 
are constants that refer to keyboard characters. For example, to test whether the last key pressed 
was the Space bar, use the following statement: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if _key. keyPressecK ) = SPACE then beepO 

In JavaScript syntax, you can access predefined constants using some of the data types that are 
unique to JavaScript syntax. For example, the Number object contains constants such as 
Number. MAX_VALUE and Number . NaN, the Math object contains constants such as Math . PI and 
Math . E, and so on. 

Note: This reference does not provide in-depth information about the predefined constants in 
JavaScript syntax. For more information on these constants, see one of the many third-party 
resources on the subject. 

In JavaScript syntax, you can also define your own custom constants by using the const keyword. 
For example, the following statement creates a constant named items, and assigns it a value of 20. 
This value cannot be changed after it has been created. 

// JavaScript syntax 
const items = 20; 

For more information on constants, see Chapter 9, “Constants,” on page 151. 

Symbols 

A symbol is a string or other value in Lingo that begins with the pound (#) sign. 

Symbols are user-defined constants. Comparisons using symbols can usually be performed very 
quickly, providing more efficient code. 

For example, the first statement below runs more quickly than the second statement: 

-- Lingo syntax 
userLevel = #novice 
userLevel = "novice" 

Symbols cannot contain spaces or punctuation. 

In both Lingo and JavaScript syntax, convert a string to a symbol by using the symbol () method. 
-- Lingo syntax 

x = symbol("novice") -- results in #novice 
// JavaScript syntax 

var x = symbol("novice"); // results in #novice 

Convert a symbol back to a string by using the string! ) function (Lingo) or the toStri ng( ) 
method (JavaScript syntax). 

-- Lingo syntax 

x = string(#novice) -- results in "novice" 

// JavaScript syntax 

var x = symbol("novice").toStringl); // results in "novice” 


20 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



In JavaScript syntax, you cannot compare symbols of the same name to determine whether they 
refer to the same symbol. To compare symbols of the same name, you must first convert them to 
strings by using the toStri ng( ) method, and then perform the comparison. 

Variables 

Director uses variables to store and update values. As the name implies, a variable contains a value 
that can be changed or updated as a movie plays. By changing the value of a variable as the movie 
plays, you can do things such as store a URL, track the number of times a user takes part in an 
online chat session, record whether a network operation is complete, and many more options. 

It is a good idea always to assign a variable a known value the first time you declare the variable. 
This is known as initializing a variable. Initializing variables makes it easier to track and compare 
the variable’s value as the movie plays. 

Variables can be global or local. A local variable exists only as long as the handler in which it is 
defined is running. A global variable can exist and retain its value as long as Director is running, 
including when a movie branches to another movie. A variable can be global within an individual 
handler, a specific script, or an entire movie; the scope depends on how the global variable is 
initialized. 

If you want a variable to be available throughout a movie, it is good practice to declare it in an on 
prepareMovie (Lingo) or a function prepareMovi e( ) (JavaScript syntax) handler. This 
ensures that the variable is available from the very start of the movie. 

For more information on using both global and local variables, see “Using global variables” 
on page 22 and “Using local variables” on page 24. 

Storing and updating values in variables 

Variables can hold data for any of the data types found in Director, such as integers, strings, TRUE 
or FALSE values, symbols, lists, or the result of a calculation. Use the equals (=) operator to store 
the values of properties and variables. 

As mentioned in the Data types section of this reference, variables in both Lingo and JavaScript 
syntax are dynamically typed, which means that they can contain different types of data at 
different times. (The ability to change a variable’s type distinguishes Lingo from other languages 
such as Java and C++, in which a variable’s type cannot be changed.) 

For example, the statement x = 1 creates the variable x, which is an integer variable because you 
assigned the variable an integer. If you subsequently use the statement x = "one", the variable x 
becomes a string variable, because the variable now contains a string. 

You can convert a string to a number by using the value!) function (Lingo) or the parselntO 
method (JavaScript syntax), or a number to a string by using the stri ng( ) function (Lingo) or 
the toStri ng( ) method (JavaScript syntax). 

The values of some properties can be both set (the value is assigned) and returned (the value is 
retrieved), and some property values can only be returned. Properties whose values can be both set 
and returned are called read/write, and those that can only be returned are called read-only. 

Often these are properties that describe some condition that exists outside the control of Director. 
For example, you cannot set the numChannel s cast member property, which indicates the number 
of channels within a movie that contains Macromedia Shockwave content. However, you 
can return the number of channels by referring to the numChannel s property of a cast member. 


Variables 21 





To assign a value to a variable: 

• Use the equals (=) operator. 

For example, the following statement assigns a URL to the variable pi acesToGo: 

// JavaScript syntax 

var placesToGo = "http://www.macromedia.com"; 

Variables can also hold the results of mathematical operations. For example, the following 
statement adds the result of an addition operation to the variable mySum: 

-- Lingo syntax 

mySum =5+5 -- this sets mySum equal to 10 

As another example, the following statement returns the cast member assigned to sprite 2 by 
retrieving the value of the sprite’s member property and places it into the variable textMember. 

-- Lingo syntax 

textMember = sprite(2).member 

It is good practice to use variable names that indicate what the variable is used for. This makes 
your scripts easier to read. For example, the variable mySum indicates that the variable contains a 
sum of numbers. 

To test the values of properties or variables: 

• Use the putt ) or the tracet ) functions in the Message window or check the values in the 
Watcher window; (putt) and tracet) provide identical functionality and are available to 
both Lingo and JavaScript syntax). 

For example, the following statement displays the value assigned to the variable myNumber in the 
Message window. 

-- Lingo syntax 
myNumber = 20 * 7 

puttmyNumber) -- displays 140 in the Message window 

// JavaScript syntax 
var myNumber =20 * 7; 

tracetmyNumber) // displays 140 in the Message window 

Using global variables 

Global variables can be shared among handlers, scripts, or movies. A global variable exists and 
retains its value as long as Director is running or until you call the clearGlobalsl ) method. 

In Macromedia Shockwave Player, global variables persist among movies displayed by the 
goToNetMovi e( ) method, but not among those displayed by the goToNetPagel ) method. 

Every handler that declares a variable as global can use the variables current value. If the handler 
changes the variable’s value, the new value is available to every other handler that treats the 
variable as global. 

It is good practice to start the names of all global variables with a lowercase g. This helps identify 
which variables are global when you examine your code. 

Director provides a way to display all current global variables and their current values and to clear 
the values of all global variables. 


22 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



To display all current global variables and their current values: 

• Use the Global object’s showGl obal s( ) method in the Message window. 

For more information on the Message window, see “Debugging in the Message window” 
on page 87. 

To clear all current global variables: 

• Use the Global object’s clearGIobalsO method in the Message window to set the value of all 
global variables to VOID (Lingo) or undefined (JavaScript syntax). 

To monitor the values of global variables during movie playback, use the Object inspector. For 
more information on the Object inspector, see “Debugging in the Object inspector” on page 91. 

Global variables in Lingo 

In Lingo, variables are considered local by default, and you do not need to precede the variable 
name with any keyword. To declare a global variable, you must precede the variable with the 
keyword gl obal. 

If you declare a global variable at the top of a script and before any handlers, the variable is 
available to all handlers in that specific script. If you declare a global variable within a handler, the 
variable is available only to that handler; however, if you declare a global variable with the same 
name within two separate handlers, an update to the variable’s value in one handler will also be 
reflected in the variable in the other handler. 

The following example illustrates working with two global variables: gScri pt, which is available 
to all handlers in the script, and gHandl er, which is available within its defining handler and any 
other handlers that declare it on the first line of the handler. 

-- Lingo syntax 

global gScript -- gScript is available to all handlers 

on mouseDown 

global gHandler 
gScript = 25 
gHandler = 30 
end 

on mouseUp 

global gHandler 

trace(gHandler) -- displays 30 
end 

In Lingo, when you use the term global to define global variables, the variables automatically 
have VOID as their initial value. 

Global variables in JavaScript syntax 

In JavaScript syntax, variables are considered global by default. The scope of a global variable can 
be determined by how and where it is declared. 

• If you declare a variable within a JavaScript syntax function without preceding the variable 
name with the keyword v a r, the variable is available to all functions within its containing 
script. 

• If you declare a variable outside a JavaScript syntax function, with or without the keyword v a r, 
the variable is available to all functions within its containing script. 


Variables 23 



• If you declare a variable inside or outside a JavaScript syntax function by using the syntax 
_gl obal . i /arName, the variable is available to all scripts within a movie. 

The following example uses the syntax _gl obal . gMovi e in one script to declare the variable 
gMovi e as global. This variable is available to all scripts within the movie. 

// JavaScript syntax 

_globa1 . gMovie = 1; // Declare gMovie in one script 

// Create a function in a separate script that operates on gMovie 
function mouseDownO { 

_gl obal .gMovie++; 
return(_global.gMovie); 


The following example declares the global variable gScri pt in one script. This variable is 
available only to functions within that script. 

// JavaScript syntax 

var gScript = 1; // Declare gScript in a script 

// gScript is available only to functions in the script that defines it 
function mouseDownO { 
gScript++; 
return(gScript); 

1 


In JavaScript syntax, when you define variables before any handlers, the variables automatically 
have undefined as their initial value. 

Using local variables 

A local variable exists only as long as the handler in which it is defined is running. However, after 
a local variable is created, you can use the variable in other expressions or change its value while a 
script is still within the handler that defined the variable. 

Treating variables as local is a good idea when you want to use a variable only temporarily in one 
handler. This helps you avoid unintentionally changing the value in another handler that uses the 
same variable name. 

To create a local variable: 

• In Lingo, assign the variable a value using the equals (=) operator. 

• In JavaScript syntax, inside a function precede the variable name with the keyword var, and 
then assign the variable a value using the equals operator. 

Note: Because JavaScript syntax variables are global by default, if you attempt to declare a local 
variable inside a function without using the keyword var, your script could produce unexpected 
behavior. Therefore, although using var is optional, it is strongly recommended that you declare all 
local JavaScript syntax variables using var to avoid any unexpected behavior. 

To display all current local variables in the handler: 

• In Lingo only, use the showLocal s () function. 

In Lingo, you can use this method in the Message window or in handlers to help with debugging. 
The result appears in the Message window. The showLocal s () method does not apply to 
JavaScript syntax. 

To monitor the values of local variables during movie playback, use the Object inspector. For 
more information on the Object inspector, see “Debugging in the Object inspector” on page 91. 


24 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



Operators 

Operators are elements that tell Lingo and JavaScript syntax scripts how to combine, compare, or 
modify the values of an expression. Many of the operators in Director are shared between Lingo 
and JavaScript syntax, and some are unique to each language. 

Some types of operators include the following: 

• Arithmetic operators (such as +, -, /, and *) 

• Comparison operators (such as <, >, and >=), which compare two arguments 

• Logical operators (not, and, or), which combine simple conditions into compound ones 

• String operators (such as &, &&, and +), which join, or concatenate, strings of characters 

Note: There are many more types of operators in JavaScript syntax than there are in Lingo, 
and not all of them are covered in this reference. For more information on additional operators 
in JavaScript 1.5, see one of the many third-party resources on the subject. 

The items that operators act upon are called operands. In Lingo, there are only binary operators. 
In JavaScript syntax, there are both binary and unary operators. A binary operator requires two 
operands, one before the operator and one after the operator. A unary operator requires a single 
operand, either before or after the operator. 

In the following example, the first statement illustrates a binary operator, where the variables x 
and y are operands and the plus (+) sign is the operator. The second statement illustrates a unary 
operator, where the variable i is the operand and ++ is the operator. 

// JavaScript syntax 
x + y; // binary operator 
i++; // unary operator 

For reference information on operators, see Chapter 13, “Operators,” on page 591. 

Understanding operator precedence 

When two or more operators are used in the same statement, some operators take precedence over 
others in a precise hierarchy to determine which operators to execute first. This is called the 
operators’ precedence order. For example, multiplication is always performed before addition. 
However, items in parentheses take precedence over multiplication. In the following example, 
without parentheses the multiplication in this statement occurs first: 

-- Lingo syntax 

total =2+4*3-- results in a value of 14 

When parentheses surround the addition operation, addition occurs first: 

-- Lingo syntax 

total = (2 + 4) * 3 -- results in a value of 18 

Descriptions of the types of operators and their precedence order follow. Operators with higher 
precedence are performed first. For example, an operator whose precedence order is 5 is 
performed before an operator whose precedence order is 4. Operations that have the same order 
of precedence are performed left to right. 


Operators 25 




Arithmetic operators 

Arithmetic operators add, subtract, multiply, divide, and perform other arithmetic operations. 
Parentheses and the minus sign are also arithmetic operators. 


Operator 

Effect 

Precedence 

( ) 

Groups operations to control precedence order. 

5 

- 

When placed before a number, reverses the sign of a number. 

5 


Performs multiplication. 

4 

mod 

(Lingo only) Performs modulo operation. 

4 

/ 

Performs division. 

4 

% 

(JavaScript syntax only) Returns the integer remainder of dividing 
two operands. 

4 

++ 

(JavaScript syntax only) Adds one to its operand. If used as a prefix 
operator (++x), returns the value of its operand after adding one. If used 
as a postfix operator (x++), returns the value of its operand before 
adding one. 

4 


(JavaScript syntax only) Subtracts one from its operand. The return 
value is analogous to that of the increment operator. 

4 

+ 

When placed between two numbers, performs addition. 

3 


When placed between two numbers, performs subtraction. 

3 


Note: In Lingo, when only integers are used in an operation, the result is an integer. Using integers 
and floating-point numbers in the same calculation results in a floating-point number. In JavaScript 
syntax, all calculations essentially result in floating-point numbers. 


When dividing one integer by another does not result in a whole number, Lingo rounds the result 
down to the nearest integer. For example, the result of 4/3 is 1. In JavaScript syntax, the actual 
floating-point value, 1.333, is returned. 

To force Lingo to calculate a value without rounding the result, use f 1 oat () on one or more 
values in an expression. For example, the result of 4/f 1 oat (3) is 1.333. 

Comparison operators 

Comparison operators compare two values and determine whether the comparison is true or false. 


Operator Meaning Precedence 

(JavaScript syntax only) Two operands are equal. If the operands are 1 
not of the same data type, JavaScript syntax attempts to convert the 
operands to an appropriate data type for the comparison. 

— (JavaScript syntax only) Two operands are equal and of the same 1 

data type 

!= (JavaScript syntax only) Two operands are not equal. If the operands 1 

are not of the same data type, JavaScript syntax attempts to convert the 
operands to an appropriate data type for the comparison. 


26 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



Operator Meaning Precedence 

!-== (JavaScript syntax only) Two operands are not equal and/or not of the 1 

same type 

<> (Lingo only) Two operands are not equal 1 

< The left operand is less than the right operand 1 

<- The left operand is less than or equal to the right operand 1 

> The left operand is greater than the right operand 1 

>- The left operand is great than or equal to the right operand 1 

(Lingo only) Two operands are equal 1 


Assignment operators 

Assignment operators assign a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. 
With the exception of the basic assignment operator, equal (=), all of the following shortcut 
assignment operators apply only to JavaScript syntax. 


Operator

x *= y 

(JavaScript syntax only) x = x * y 

1 

x /= y 

(JavaScript syntax only) x = x / y 

1 

x %= y 

(JavaScript syntax only) x = x °/o y

Logical operators 

Logical operators test whether two logical expressions are true or false. 

Use care when using logical operators and string operators in Lingo and JavaScript syntax. For 
example, in JavaScript syntax && is a logical operator that determines whether two expressions are 
true, but in Lingo, && is a string operator that concatenates two strings and inserts a space 


between the two expressions. 

Operator Effect Precedence 

and (Lingo only) Determines whether both expressions are true 4 

&& (JavaScript syntax only) Determines whether both expressions are true 4 

or (Lingo only) Determines whether either or both expressions are true 4 

| | (JavaScript syntax only) Determines whether either or both expressions 4 

are true 

not (Lingo only) Negates an expression 5 

! (JavaScript syntax only) Negates an expression 5 


Operators 27 



The not (Lingo) or ! (JavaScript syntax) operator is useful for toggling a TRUE or FALSE value to 
its opposite. For example, the following statement turns on the sound if it’s currently off and 
turns off the sound if it’s currently on: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_sound.soundEnabled = not (_sound.soundEnabl ed) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_sound.soundEnabled = !(_sound.soundEnabl ed); 

String operators 

String operators combine and define strings. 

Use care when using logical operators and string operators in Lingo and JavaScript syntax. For 
example, in JavaScript syntax && is a logical operator that determines whether two expressions are 
true, but in Lingo, && is a string operator that concatenates two strings and inserts a space 
between the two expressions.

Conditional constructs 

By default, Director always executes script statements starting with the first statement and 
continuing in order until it reaches the final statement or a statement that instructs a script to go 
somewhere else. 

The order in which statements are executed affects the order in which you should place 
statements. For example, if you write a statement that requires some calculated value, you need to 
put the statement that calculates the value first. 

The first statement in the following example adds two numbers, and the second statement assigns 
a string representation of the sum to a field cast member named Answer, which appears on the 
Stage. The second statement could not be placed before the first statement because the variable x 
has not yet been defined. 

-- Lingo syntax 
x = 2 + 2 

membert"Answer").text = string(x) 

// JavaScript syntax 
var x = 2 + 2; 

membert"Answer").text = x.toStringt); 


28 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



Both Lingo and JavaScript syntax provide conventions for altering the default execution order or 
script statements, and for performing actions depending on specific conditions. For example, you 
may want to do the following in your scripts: 

• Execute a set of statements if a logical condition is true, or execute alternate statements if the 
logical condition is false. 

• Evaluate an expression and attempt to match the expression’s value to a specific condition. 

• Execute a set of statements repeatedly until a specific condition is met. 

Testing for logical conditions 

To execute a statement or set of statements if a specified condition is true or false, you use the 
if. . .then. . .else (Lingo) or i f. . . el se (JavaScript syntax) structures. For example, you can 
create an if...then...else or if...then structure that tests whether text has finished 
downloading from the Internet and, if it has, then attempts to format the text. These structures 
use the following pattern to test for logical conditions: 

• In both Lingo and JavaScript syntax, statements that check whether a condition is true or false 
begin with the term i f. 

• In Lingo, if the condition exists, the statements following the term then are executed. In 
JavaScript syntax, curly brackets (I () take the place of the Lingo term then, and must 
surround each individual i f, el se, or el se i f statement. 

• In both Lingo and JavaScript syntax, if the condition does not exist, scripts skip to the next 
statement in the handler using the term el se or el se if. 

• In Lingo, the term end if specifies the end of the i f test. In JavaScript syntax, the i f test ends 
automatically, so there is no term that explicitly ends the test. 

To optimize your script’s performance, test for the most likely conditions first. 

The following statements test several conditions. The term else if specifies alternative tests to 
perform if previous conditions are false: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if _mouse.mouseMember = member(l) then 
_movie.got"Cairo") 

else if _mouse.mouseMember = member(2) then 
_movie.got"Nairobi") 
el se 

_pl ayer.alertt"You’re lost.") 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_mouse.mouseMember = member(l)) { 

_movie.got"Cairo"); 

1 

else if (_mouse.mouseMember = member(2)) { 

_movie.got"Nairobi"); 

1 

el se ( 

_pl ayer.alertt"You’re lost."); 

1 


Conditional constructs 29 



When writing if. . .then structures in Lingo, you can place the statement or statements 
following then in the same line as then, or you can place them on their own line by inserting a 
carriage return after then. If you insert a carriage return, you must also include an end if 
statement at the end of the if. . .then structure. 

When writing i f structures in JavaScript syntax, you can place the statement or statements 
following i f in the same line as i f, or you can place them on their own line by inserting a 
carriage return after i f. 

For example, the following statements are equivalent: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if _mouse.mouseMember = member(l) then _movie.go("Cairo") 

if _mouse.mouseMember = member(l) then 
_movie.got"Cairo") 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 

if (_mouse.mouseMember = member(l)) { _movie.got"Cairo"); } 

if (_mouse.mouseMember = membertl)) 1 
_movie.got"Cairo"); 

1 

For reference information on using the if. . .then. . .else and if. . .else structures, see “if” 
on page 209. 

Evaluating and matching expressions 

The case (Lingo) or swi tch . . . case (JavaScript syntax) structures are shorthand alternatives to 
using if. . .then. . .else or if. . .then structures when setting up multiple branching 
structures. The case and switch. . .case structures are often more efficient and easier to read 
than many if. . . then . . .else or if. . .then structures. 

In Lingo, the condition to test for follows the term case in the first line of the case structure. 
The comparison goes through each line in order until Lingo encounters an expression that 
matches the test condition. When a matching expression is found, Director executes the Lingo 
that follows the matching expression. 

In JavaScript syntax, the condition to test for follows the term switch in the first line of the 
structure. Each comparison in the test follows the term case for each line that contains a test. 
Each case comparison can be ended by using the optional term break. Including the term break 
breaks the program out of the switch structure and executes any statements following the 
structure. If break is omitted, the following case comparison is executed. 

A case or swi tch . . .case structure can use comparisons as the test condition. 

For example, the following case and switch. . .case structures test which key the user pressed 
most recently and responds accordingly. 

• If the user pressed A, the movie goes to the frame labeled Apple. 

• If the user pressed B or C, the movie performs the specified transition and then goes to the 
frame labeled Oranges. 


30 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



• If the user pressed any other letter key, the computer beeps. 

-- Lingo syntax 
case (_key.key) of 

"a" : _movie.go("Apple") 

" b", " c": 

_movie.puppetT ransition(99) 

_movie.go("Oranges") 
otherwise: _sound.beep() 
end case 

// JavaScript syntax 
switch (_key.key) { 
case "a" : 

_movie.got"Appie"); 
break; 
case "b": 

_movie.puppetTransition(99); 

_movie.got"Oranges"); 
break; 
case "c": 

_movie.puppetTransition(99); 

_movie.got"Oranges"); 
break; 

default: _sound.beept) 


Note: In JavaScript syntax, only one comparison can be made per case statement. 
For reference information on using case structures, see “case” on page 203. 


Repeating actions 

In both Lingo and JavaScript syntax, you can repeat an action a specified number of times or 
while a specific condition exists. 

In Lingo, to repeat an action a specified number of times you use a repeat with structure. 
Specify the number of times to repeat as a range following repeat with. 

In JavaScript syntax, to repeat an action a specified number of times you use the for structure. 
The for structure takes three parameters: the first parameter typically initializes a counter 
variable, the second parameter specifies a condition to evaluate each time through the loop, and 
the third parameter is typically used to update or increment the counter variable. 

The repeat wi th and for structures are useful for performing the same operation on a series of 
objects. For example, the following loop makes Background Transparent the ink for sprites 2 
through 10: 

-- Lingo syntax 
repeat with n = 2 to 10 
sprite(n).ink = 36 
end repeat 

// JavaScript syntax 
for (var n=2; n<=10; n++) { 
sprite(n).ink = 36; 

1 


Conditional constructs 31 




The following example performs a similar action, but with decreasing numbers: 

-- Lingo syntax 
repeat with n = 10 down to 2 
sprite(n).ink = 36 
end repeat 

// JavaScript syntax 
for (var n=10; n>=2; n--) 1 
sprite(n).ink = 36; 

1 


In Lingo, to repeat a set of instructions as long as a specific condition exists, use the repeat 
while structure. 

In JavaScript syntax, to repeat a set of instructions as long as a specific condition exists, use the 
while structure. 

For example, the following statements instruct a movie to beep continuously whenever the mouse 
button is being pressed: 

-- Lingo syntax 
repeat while _mouse.mouseDown 
_sound.beep() 
end repeat 

// JavaScript syntax 
while (_mouse.mouseDown) 1 
_sound.beep(); 

1 


Both Lingo and JavaScript syntax scripts continue to loop through the statements inside the loop 
until the condition is no longer true, or until one of the statements sends the script outside the 
loop. In the previous example, the script exits the loop when the mouse button is released because 
the mouseDown condition is no longer true. 

In Lingo, to exit a loop, use the exi t repeat statement. 

In JavaScript syntax, to exit a loop you can use the term brea k. A loop also automatically exits 
when a condition is no longer true. 

For example, the following statements make a movie beep while the mouse button is pressed, 
unless the mouse pointer is over sprite 1. If the pointer is over sprite 1, the script exits the 
loop and stops beeping. The rol 1 over( ) method indicates whether the pointer is over the 
specified sprite. 

-- Lingo syntax 
repeat while _mouse.sti 11 Down 
_sound.beep() 

i f _movie.rollOver(1) then exit repeat 
end repeat 

// JavaScript syntax 
while (_mouse.sti11 Down) { 

_sound.beep(); 
if (_movie.rol1Over(1)) { 
break;

32 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



Events, messages, and handlers 

A key component to creating powerful, useful scripts is an understanding of the concepts and 
functionality of events, messages, and handlers. Understanding the order in which events and 
messages are sent and received will help you determine exactly when specific scripts or parts of 
scripts should run. It will also help you debug scripts when specific actions are not occurring 
when you expect them to occur. 

When a movie plays, the following occurs: 

1 Events occur in response to either a system or user-defined action 

2 Messages that correspond to these events are sent to the scripts in a movie 

3 Handlers within scripts contain the instructions that run when a specific message is received 

The name of an event corresponds to the name of the message it generates, and the handler that 
handles the event corresponds to both the event and the message. For example, when the event 
named mouseDown occurs, Director generates and sends to scripts a message named mouseDown, 
which would in turn be handled by a handler named mouseDown. 

Events 

There are two categories of events that occur when a movie plays: 

• System events occur without a user interacting with the movie, and are predefined and 
named in Director. For example, when the playhead enters a frame, when a sprite is clicked, 
and so on. 

• User-defined events occur in response to actions that you define. For example, you could 
create an event that occurs when the background color of a sprite changes from red to blue, 
when a sound has played five times, and so on. 

Many system events, such as prepareFrame, beginSprite, and so on, occur automatically and 
in a predefined order while a movie is playing. Other system events, particularly mouse events 
such as mouseDown, mouseUp, and so on, do not necessarily occur automatically while a movie is 
playing, but rather when a user triggers them. 

For example, when a movie first starts, the prepareMovi e event always occurs first, the 
prepareFrame event always occurs second, and so on. However, the mouseDown and mouseUp 
events may never occur in a movie unless a user triggers them by clicking the movie. 

The following lists illustrate the system events that always occur during a movie, and the order in 
which they occur. 

When the movie first starts, events occur in the following order: 

1 prepareMovie 

2 prepareFrame Immediately after the prepareFrame event, Director plays sounds, draws 
sprites, and performs any transitions or palette effects. This event occurs before the enter Frame 
event. A prepareFrame handler is a good location for script that you want to run before the 
frame draws. 

3 beginSprite This event occurs when the playhead enters a sprite span. 

4 startMovie This event occurs in the first frame that plays. 


Events, messages, and handlers 33 



When the movie encounters a frame, events occur in the following order: 

1 beginSprite This event occurs only if new sprites begin in the frame. 

2 stepFrame 

3 prepareFrame 

4 enterFrame After enterFrame and before exi tFrame, Director handles any time delays 
required by the tempo setting, idle events, and keyboard and mouse events. 

5 exitFrame 

6 endSpri te This event occurs only if the playhead exits a sprite in the frame. 

When a movie stops, events occur in the following order: 

1 endSpri te This event occurs only if sprites currently exist in the movie. 

2 stopMovie 

For reference information on the predefined system events in Director, see Chapter 10, “Events 
and Messages,” on page 159. 

Messages 

To run the appropriate set of script statements at the right time, Director must determine what is 
occurring in the movie and which statements to run in response to certain events. 

Director sends messages to indicate when specific events occur in a movie, such as when sprites 
are clicked, keyboard keys are pressed, a movie starts, the playhead enters or exits a frame, or a 
script returns a certain result. 

The general order in which messages are sent to objects is as follows: 

1 Messages are sent first to behaviors attached to a sprite involved in the event. If a sprite has more 
than one behavior attached to it, behaviors respond to the message in the order in which they 
are attached to the sprite. 

2 Messages are sent next to a script attached to the cast member assigned to the sprite. 

3 Messages are then sent to behaviors attached to the current frame. 

4 Messages are sent last to movie scripts. 

Although you can define your own message names, most common events that occur in a movie 
have built-in message names. 

For reference information on the built-in messages in Director, see Chapter 10, “Events and 
Messages,” on page 159. 

Defining custom messages 

In addition to using built-in message names, you can define your own messages and 
corresponding handler names. A custom message can call another script, another handler, or 
the statement’s own handler. When the called handler stops executing, the handler that called 
it resumes. 

A custom message and handler name must meet the following criteria: 

• It must start with a letter. 

• It must include alphanumeric characters only (no special characters or punctuation). 


34 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



• It must consist of one word or of several words connected by an underscore—no spaces 
are allowed. 

• It must be different from the name of any predefined Lingo or JavaScript syntax element. 

Using predefined Lingo or JavaScript keywords for message and handler names can create 
confusion. Although it is possible to explicitly replace or extend the functionality of a Lingo or 
JavaScript element by using it as a message or handler name, this should be done only in certain 
advanced situations. 

When you have multiple handlers with similar functions, it is useful to give them names that have 
similar beginnings so they appear together in an alphabetical listing, such as the listing that can be 
displayed by the Edit > Find > Handler command. 

Handlers 

A handler is a set of statements within a script that runs in response to a specific event and 
subsequent message. Although Director contains built-in events and messages, you must create 
your own custom handlers for each event/message pair that you want to handle. 

Deciding where to place handlers 

You can place handlers in any type of script, and a script can contain multiple handlers. It’s a good 
idea to group related handlers in a single place, though, for easier maintenance. 

The following are some useful guidelines for many common situations: 

• To associate a handler with a specific sprite, or to have a handler run in response to an action 
on a specific sprite, put the handler in a behavior attached to the sprite. 

• To set up a handler that should be available any time the movie is in a specific frame, put the 
handler in a behavior attached to the frame. 

For example, to have a handler respond to a mouse click while the playhead is in a frame, 
regardless of where the click occurs, place a mouseDown or mouseUp handler in the frame 
behavior rather than in a sprite behavior. 

• To set up a handler that runs in response to messages about events anywhere in the movie, put 
the handler in a movie script. 

• To set up a handler that runs in response to an event that affects a cast member, regardless of 
which sprites use the cast member, put the handler in a cast member script. 

Determining when handlers receive a message 

After sending a message to scripts, Director checks for handlers in a definite order. 

1 Director first checks whether a handler exists in the object from which the message was sent. If 
a handler is found, the message is intercepted, and the script in the handler runs. 

2 If no handler is found, Director then checks cast member, in ascending order, for any associated 
movie scripts that might contain a handler for the message. If a handler is found, the message is 
intercepted, and the script in the handler runs. 

3 If no handler is found, Director then checks whether a frame script contains a handler for the 
message. If a handler is found, the message is intercepted, and the script in the handler runs. 

4 If no handler is found, Director then checks sprites, in ascending order, for any scripts 
associated with the sprites that might contain a handler for the message. If a handler is found, 
the message is intercepted, and the script in the handler runs. 


Events, messages, and handlers 35 



After a handler intercepts a message, the message does not automatically pass on to the remaining 
locations. However, in Lingo you can use the pass () method to override this default rule and 
pass the message to other objects. 

If no matching handler is found after the message passes to all possible locations, Director ignores 
the message. 

The exact order of objects to which Director sends a message depends on the message. For 
information on the sequence of objects to which Director sends specific messages, see the entry 
for each message in Chapter 10, “Events and Messages,” on page 159. 

Using parameters to pass values to a handler 

By using parameters for values, you can give the handler exactly the values that it needs to use at a 
specific time, regardless of where or when you call the handler in the movie. Parameters can be 
optional or required, depending on the situation. 

To create parameters for a handler: 

• In Lingo, put the parameters after the handler name. In JavaScript syntax, put the parameters 
within parentheses, and then put them after the handler name. Use commas to separate 
multiple parameters. 

When you call a handler, you must provide specific values for the parameters that the handler 
uses. You can use any type of value, such as a number, a variable that has a value assigned, or a 
string of characters. Values in the calling statement must be in the order that they follow in the 
handlers parameters, and they must be surrounded by parentheses. 

In the following example, the variable assignment mySum calls the method addThem, which is 
passed the two values 2 and 4. The addThem handler replaces the parameter placeholders a and b 
with the two values passed to it, stores the result in the local variable c, and then uses the keyword 
return to send the result back to the original method, which is then assigned to mySum. 

Because 2 is first in the list of parameters, it is substituted for a in the handler. Likewise, because 4 
is second in the list of parameters, it is substituted for b in the handler. 

-- Lingo syntax 

mySum = addThem(2, 4) -- calling statement 

on addThem a, b -- handler 
c = a + b 

return c -- returns the result to the calling statement 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

var mySum = addThem(2, 4); // calling statement 

function addThemla, b) { // handler 
c = a + b; 

return c; // returns the result to the calling statement 

1 

In Lingo, when you call a custom method from an object, a reference to the script object in 
memory is always passed as an implied first parameter to the handler for that method. This means 
that you must account for the script object reference in your handler. 


36 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



For example, consider that you wrote a custom sprite method named j ump( ) that takes a single 
integer as a parameter, and you placed the method in a behavior. When you call j ump( ) from a 
sprite object reference, the handler must also include a parameter that represents the script object 
reference, and not just the single integer. In this case, the implied parameter is represented by the 
keyword me, but any term will work. 

-- Lingo syntax 

myHeight = sprite(2).jump(5) 

on jump(me,a) 

return a + 15 -- this handler works correctly, and returns 20 
end 

on jump(a) 

return a + 15 -- this handler does not work correctly, and returns 0 
end 

You can also use expressions as values. For example, the following statement substitutes 3+6 for a 
and 8>2 (or 1, representing TRUE) for b, and would return 10: 

-- Lingo syntax 

mySum = addThem(3+6, 8>2) 

In Lingo, each handler begins with the word on followed by the message that the handler should 
respond to. The last line of the handler is the word end. You can repeat the handler’s name after 
end, but this is optional. 

In JavaScript syntax, each handler begins with the word function followed by the message that 
the handler should respond to. The statements that comprise the handler are surrounded by 
opening and closing brackets, as are all JavaScript syntax functions. 

Returning results from handlers 

Often, you want a handler to report some condition or the result of some action. 

To return results from a handler: 

• Use the keyword return to have a handler report a condition or the result of an action. For 
example, the following f i ndCol or handler returns the current color of sprite 1: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on findColor 

return sprite( 1 ).foreCol or 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function findCoIorO { 

return(sprited) .foreColor); 


You can also use the keyword return by itself to exit from the current handler and return no 
value. For example, the following j ump handler returns nothing if the aVal parameter equals 5; 
otherwise, it returns a value. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on jump(aVal) 

if aVal = 5 then return 

aVal = aVal + 10 
return aVal 
end 


Events, messages, and handlers 37 



// JavaScript syntax 
function jump(aVal) { 
if(a V a 1 == 5) 1 
return; 

} 

el se 1 

aVal = aVal + 10; 
return(aVal ); 

} 

! 


When you define a handler that returns a result, you must use parentheses after the handler when 
you call it from another handler. For example, the statement put(findColorO) calls the o n 
f i ndCol or handler and then displays the result in the Message window. 

Linear lists and property lists 

In your scripts, you may want to track and update lists of data, such as a series of names or the 
values assigned to a set of variables. Both Lingo and JavaScript syntax have access to linear lists 
and property lists. In a linear list, each element in the list is a single value. In a property list, each 
element in the list contains two values; the first value is a property name, and the second value is 
the value associated with that property. 

Because both Lingo and JavaScript syntax have access to linear and property lists, it is 
recommended that you use linear lists and property lists if values in your code are shared between 
Lingo and JavaScript syntax scripts. 

If values in your code are used only in JavaScript syntax scripts, it is recommended that you use 
JavaScript Array objects to work with lists of data. For more information on using arrays, see 
“JavaScript syntax arrays” on page 45. 

Creating linear lists 

You create a linear list in one of the following ways: 

• In Lingo, use either the top level list!) function or the list operator ([ ]), using commas to 
separate items in the list. 

• In JavaScript syntax, use the top level 1 i st () function, using commas to separate items in 
the list. 

The index into a linear list always starts with 1. 

When you use the top level 1 i st () function, you specify the list’s elements as parameters of the 
function. This function is useful when you use a keyboard that does not provide square brackets. 

All of the following statements create a linear list of three names and assign it to a variable. 

-- Lingo syntax 

workerList = ["Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos"] -- using the Lingo list operator 
workerList = 1ist("Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos") -- using 1ist() 

// JavaScript syntax 

var workerList = 1ist("Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos"); // using list!) 


38 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



You can also create empty linear lists. The following statements create empty linear lists. 

-- Lingo syntax 

workerList = [] -- using the Lingo list operator 
workerList = listO -- using listO with no parameters 

// JavaScript syntax 

var workerList = listO; // using listO with no parameters 

Creating property lists 

You create a property list in one of the following ways: 

• In Lingo, use either the top level prop Li st( ) function or the list operator ([:]). When using 
the list operator to create a property list, you can use a either a colon to designate name/value 
elements and commas to separate elements in the list, or commas to both designate name/value 
elements and to separate elements in the list. 

• In JavaScript syntax, use the top level prop Li st( ) function and insert commas to both 
designate name/value elements and to separate elements in the list. 

When you use the top level prop Li st( ) function, you specify the property list’s elements as 
parameters of the function. This function is useful when you use a keyboard that does not provide 
square brackets. 

Properties can appear more than once in a given property list. 

All of the following statements create a property list with four property names— 1 eft, top, 
right, and bottom —and their corresponding values. 

-- Lingo syntax 

spritelLoc = [#1 eft: 100 , #top:150, #right:300, //bottom: 350] 
spritelLoc = ["left",400, "top",550, "right",500, "bottom",750] 
spritelLoc = propList("1 eft",400, "top",550, "right",500, "bottom",750) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var spritelLoc = propList("1 eft",400, "top",550, "right",500, "bottom",750); 
You can also create empty property lists. The following statements create empty property lists. 

-- Lingo syntax 

spritelLoc = [:] -- using the Lingo property list operator 
spritelLoc = propList() -- using propList() with no parameters 

// JavaScript syntax 

var spritelLoc = propLi st(); // using propListO with no parameters 

Setting and retrieving items in lists 

You can set and retrieve individual items in a list. The syntax differs for linear and property lists. 

To set a value in a linear list, do one of the following: 

• Use the equals (=) operator. 

• Use the setAt( ) method. 


Linear lists and property lists 39 



The following statements illustrate defining the linear list worker Li st that contains one value, 
Heather, and then adds Carlos as the second value in the list. 

-- Lingo syntax 

workerList = ["Heather"] -- define a linear list 

workerList[2] = "Carlos" -- set the second value using the equal operator 
workerLi st. setAt( 2 , "Carlos") -- set the second value using setAtO 

// JavaScript syntax 

var workerList = 1ist("Heather"); // define a linear list 

workerList[2] = "Carlos"; // set the second value using the equal operator 

workerLi st. setAt( 2 , "Carlos"); // set the second value using setAtO 

To retrieve a value in a linear list: 

• Use the list variable followed by the number that indicates the value’s position in the list. Place 
square brackets around the number. 

• Use the getAt() method. 

The following statements create the linear list workerList, and then assign the second value in 
the list to the variable name2. 

-- Lingo syntax 

workerList = ["Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos"] -- define a linear list 
name2 = workerList[2] -- use bracketed access to retrieve "Heather" 
name2 = workerList.getAt(2) -- use getAt() to retrieve "Heather" 

// JavaScript syntax 

var workerList = 1ist("Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos"); 

var name2 = workerList[2] // use bracketed access to retrieve "Heather” 
var name2 = worker List.getAt(2) // use getAt() to retrieve "Heather" 

To set a value in a property list, do one of the following: 

• Use the equals (=) operator. 

• In Lingo only, use the setaPropl) method. 

• Use dot syntax. 

The following Lingo statement uses the equals operator to make sushi the new value associated 
with the property Bruno. 

-- Lingo syntax 

foodList = [:] -- define an empty property list 
foodList[#Bruno] = "sushi" -- associate sushi with Bruno 

The following Lingo statement uses setapropO to make sushi the new value associated with 
the property Bruno. 

-- Lingo syntax 

foodList = [:] -- define an empty property list 
foodList.setaProp(#Bruno, "sushi") -- use setaPropO 

// JavaScript syntax 

foodList = propListO -- define an empty property list 
foodLi st. setaPropl "Bruno", "sushi") -- use setaPropO 

The following statements use dot syntax to set the value associated with Bruno from sushi to 
teriyaki. 


40 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



-- Lingo syntax 

foodList = [#Bruno:"sushi"] -- define a property list 
trace(foodList) -- displays [#Bruno: "sushi"] 

foodList.Bruno = "teriyaki" -- use dot syntax to set the value of Bruno 
trace(foodList) -- displays [#Bruno: "teriyaki"] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var foodList = propList("Bruno", "sushi"); // define a property list 
trace(foodList); // displays ["Bruno": "sushi"] 

foodList.Bruno = "teriyaki" // use dot syntax to set the value of Bruno 
trace(foodList) -- displays [#Bruno: "teriyaki"] 

To retrieve a value in a property list, do one of the following: 

• Use the list variable followed by the name of the property associated with the value. Place 
square brackets around the property. 

• Use the getaProp!) or getPropAt() methods. 

• Use dot syntax. 

The following statements use bracketed access to retrieve the values associated with the properties 
breakfast and lunch. 

-- Lingo syntax 
-- define a property list 

foodList = [#breakfast:"Waffles", #lunch:"Tofu Burger"] 
trace(foodList[#breakfast]) -- displays "Waffles" 
trace!foodList[#lunch]) -- displays "Tofu Burger" 

// JavaScript syntax 
// define a property list 

var foodList = propList("breakfast", "Waffles", "lunch", "Tofu Burger"); 
trace(foodList["breakfast"]); // displays Waffles 
trace(foodList["lunch"]); // displays Tofu Burger 

The following statements use getaPropO to retrieve the value associated with the property 
breakfast, and getPropAtO to retrieve the property at the second index position in the list. 

-- Lingo syntax 
-- define a property list 

foodList = [#breakfast:"Waffles", #lunch:"Tofu Burger"] 
trace!foodList.getaProp(#breakfast)) -- displays "Waffles" 
trace!foodList.getPropAt!2)) -- displays #lunch 

// JavaScript syntax 
// define a property list 

var foodList = propList!"breakfast", "Waffles", "lunch", "Tofu Burger"); 
trace!foodList.getaProp!"breakfast")) // displays Waffles 
trace!foodList.getPropAt(2)) // displays lunch 

The following statements use dot syntax to access the values associated with properties in a 
property list. 

-- Lingo syntax 
-- define a property list 

foodList = [#breakfast:"Waffles", #lunch:"Tofu Burger"] 
trace!foodList.breakfast) -- displays "Waffles" 

// JavaScript syntax 
// define a property list 

var foodList = propList!"breakfast", "Waffles", "lunch", "Tofu Burger"); 
trace(foodList.1unch); // displays Tofu Burger 


Linear lists and property lists 41 



Checking items in lists 

You can determine the characteristics of a list and the number of items the list contains by 
using the following methods. 

• To display the contents of a list, use the p u t ( ) or trace!) functions, passing the variable that 
contains the list as a parameter. 

• To determine the number of items in a list, use the count () method (Lingo only) or the 
count property. 

• To determine a list’s type, use the i 1 k () method. 

• To determine the maximum value in a list, use the max () method. 

• To determine the minimum value in a list, use the mi n () function. 

• To determine the position of a specific property, use the findPos, findPosNear,or 
getOne command. 

The following statements use count () and count to display the number of items in a list. 

-- Lingo syntax 

workerList = ["Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos"] -- define a linear list 
trace!workerList.count!)) - - displays 3 
trace!workerList.count) - - displays 3 

// JavaScript syntax 

var workerList = 1ist("Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos"); // define a linear list 
trace(workerList.count); // displays 3 

The following statements use ilk!) to determine a list’s type. 

-- Lingo syntax 

x = ["1", "2", "3"] 

trace(x.i1k()) // returns #list 

// JavaScript syntax 

var x = 1ist("1", "2", "3"); 

trace(x.i1k()) // returns #list 

The following statements use max!) and min!) to determine the maximum and minimum values 
in a list. 

-- Lingo syntax 

workerList = ["Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos"] -- define a linear list 
tracetworkerList.max!)) -- displays "Heather" 
trace(workerList.min()) -- displays "Bruno" 

// JavaScript syntax 

var workerList = 1ist("Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos"); // define a linear list 
tracetworkerList.max!)); // displays Heather 
trace(workerList.min()); // displays Bruno 

The following statements use findPos to get the index position of a specified property in a 
property list. 

-- Lingo syntax 
-- define a property list 

foodList = [#breakfast:"Waffles", #lunch:"Tofu Burger"] 
trace!foodList.findPos(#1unch)) -- displays 2 

// JavaScript syntax 
// define a property list 

var foodList = propList!"breakfast", "Waffles", "lunch", "Tofu Burger"); 
trace!foodList.findPos("breakfast")); // displays 1 


42 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



Adding and deleting items in lists 

You can add or delete items in a list by using the following methods. 

• To add an item at the end of a list, use the append () method. 

• To add an item at its proper position in a sorted list, use the add() or addProp() methods. 

• To add an item at a specific place in a linear list, use the addAt () method. 

• To add an item at a specific position in a property list, use the addProp() method. 

• To delete an item from a list, use the del eteAt(), del eteOnel), or del eteProp() methods. 

• To replace an item in a list, use the setAt() or setaProp() methods. 

The following statements use append () to add an item to the end of a list. 

-- Lingo syntax 

workerList = ["Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos"] -- define a linear list 
worker List.append!"Davi d") 

traceiworkerLi st) -- displays ["Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos", "David"] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var workerList = 1ist("Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos"); // define a linear list 
worker List.append("Davi d"); 

tracetworkerList); // displays ["Bruno", "Heather", "Carlos", "David"] 

The following statements use addPropO to add a property and an associated value to a 
property list. 

-- Lingo syntax 
-- define a property list 

foodList = [i/breakfast:"Waffles", #lunch:"Tofu Burger"] 

foodLi st. addProp(#di nner, "Spaghetti") -- adds [[/dinner: "Spaghetti”] 

// JavaScript syntax 
// define a property list 

var foodList = propList("breakfast", "Waffles", "lunch", "Tofu Burger"); 
foodList.addPropt"dinner", "Spaghetti"); // adds ["dinner": "Spaghetti”] 

You do not have to explicitly remove lists. Lists are automatically removed when they are no 
longer referred to by any variable. Other types of objects must be removed explicitly, by setting 
variables that refer to them to VOID (Lingo) or nul 1 (JavaScript syntax). 


Copying lists 

Assigning a list to a variable and then assigning that variable to a second variable does not make a 
separate copy of the list. For example, the first statement below creates a list that contains the 
names of two continents, and assigns the list to the variable 1 and Li st. The second statement 
assigns the same list to a new variable continent List. In the third statement, adding Australia 
to 1 andLi st also automatically adds Austral i a to the list conti nentLi st. This happens 
because both variable names point to the same list object in memory. The same behavior occurs 
by using an array in JavaScript syntax. 

-- Lingo syntax 

landList = ["Asia", "Africa"] 

conti nentLi st = landList 

1andList.add("Australia") -- this also adds "Australia" to continentList 


Linear lists and property lists 43 



To create a copy of a list that is independent of another list: 

• Use the dupl i cate () method. 

For example, the following statements create a list and then make an independent copy of the list. 

-- Lingo syntax 

oldList = ["a", "b", "c"] 

newList = oldList.duplicate() -- makes an independent copy of oldList 

// JavaScript syntax 

var oldList = listC'a", "b", " c"); 

var newList = oldList.duplicate(); // makes an independent copy of oldList 
After newLi st is created, editing either ol dLi st or newLi st has no effect on the other. 

Sorting lists 

Lists are sorted in alphanumeric order, with numbers being sorted before strings. Strings are 
sorted according to their initial letters, regardless of how many characters they contain. Sorted 
lists perform slightly faster than unsorted lists. 

A linear list is sorted according to the values in the list. A property list is sorted according to the 
property names in the list or array. 

After the values in a linear or property list are sorted, they will remain sorted, even as values are 
added to or removed from the lists. 

To sort a list: 

• Use the sort! ) method. 

For example, the following statements sort a nonsorted alphabetical list. 

-- Lingo syntax 

oldList = ["d", "a", "c", "b"] 

oldList.sort!) -- results in ["a", "b", "c", "d"] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var oldList = listed", "a", "c", "b"); 

oldList.sort(); // results in ["a", "b", "c", "d"] 

Creating multidimensional lists 

You can also create multidimensional lists that enable you to work with the values of more than 
one list at a time. 

In the following example, the first two statements create the separate linear lists 1 i stl and 1 i st2. 
The third statement creates a multidimensional list and assigns it to mdLi st. To access the values 
in a multidimensional list, the fourth and fifth statements use brackets to access the values in the 
list; the first bracket provides access to a specified list, and the second bracket provides access to 
the value at a specified index position in the list. 

-- Lingo syntax 
1istl = !ist(5,10) 

1ist2 = 1ist(15,20) 
mdList = listdistl, 1 i s 12) 
tracetmdListC1][2]) -- displays 10 
tracetmdListC2][1]) -- displays 15 


44 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



// JavaScript syntax 

var 1istl = 1ist(5,10); 

var 1ist2 = list(15,20); 

var mdList = listdistl, 1 i s12); 

tracetmdListC1][2]); // displays 10 

trace(mdListC2][1]); // displays 15 

JavaScript syntax arrays 

JavaScript syntax arrays are similar to Lingo-style linear lists in that each element in an array is a 
single value. One of the main differences between JavaScript syntax arrays and Lingo-style linear 
lists is that the index into an array always starts with 0. 

You create a JavaScript syntax array by using the Array object. You can use either square brackets 
([ ]) or the Array constructor to create an array. The following two statements create an array 
with two values. 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myArray = [10, 15]; // using square brackets 

var myArray = new ArraydO, 15); // using the Array constructor 

You can also create empty arrays. The following two statements create an empty array. 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myArray = []; 

var myArray = new Array!); 

Note: The Director Scripting Reference does not include a complete reference for JavaScript syntax 
Array objects. For more complete information on using Array objects, see one of the many third-party 
resources on the subject. 

Checking items in arrays 

You can determine the characteristics of an array and the number of items the array contains by 
using the following methods. 

• To display the contents of a list, use the put!) or trace!) function, passing the variable that 
contains the list as a parameter. 

• To determine the number of items in an array, use the Array object’s length property. 

• To determine an array’s type, use the constructor property. 

The following example illustrates determining the number of items in an array using the 
length property, and then returning the type of object using the constructor property. 

// JavaScript syntax 

var x = ["1", "2", "3"]; 

traced, length) // displays 3 

traced.conductor == Array) // displays true 

Adding and deleting items in arrays 

You can add or delete items in an array by using the following methods: 

• To add an item at the end of an array, use the Array object’s push!) method. 

• To add an item at its proper position in a sorted array, use the Array object’s splice! ) method. 

• To add an item at a specific position in an array, use the Array object’s spl i ce( ) method. 


JavaScript syntax arrays 45 



• To delete an item from an array, use the Array object’s splice!) method. 

• To replace an item in an array, use the Array objects splice!) method. 

The following example illustrates using the Array object’s splice!) method to add items to, 
delete items from, and replace items in an array. 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myArray = new Array!"1", "2"); 

tracetmyArray); displays 1,2 

myArray.push!"5"); // adds the value "5" to the end of myArray 
tracetmyArray); // displays 1,2,5 

myArray.splice(3, 0, "4"); // adds the value "4" after the value "5" 
tracetmyArray); // displays 1,2,5,4 

myArray.sort!); // sort myArray 
tracetmyArray); // displays 1,2,4,5 

myArray.splice(2, 0, "3"); 
tracetmyArray); // displays 1,2,3,4,5 

myArray.splice(3, 2); // delete two values at index positions 3 and 4 
tracetmyArray); // displays 1,2,3 

myArray.splice(2, 1, "7"); // replaces one value at index position 2 with "7" 
tracetmyArray); displays 1,2,7 

Copying arrays 

Assigning an array to a variable and then assigning that variable to a second variable does not 
make a separate copy of the array. 

For example, the first statement below creates an array that contains the names of two continents, 
and assigns the array to the variable 1 and Li st. The second statement assigns the same list to a 
new variable conti nentLi st. In the third statement, adding Austral i a to 1 andLi st also 
automatically adds Austral i a to the array conti nentLi st. This happens because both variable 
names point to the same Array object in memory. 

// JavaScript syntax 

var landArray = new Array!"Asia", "Africa"); 
var continentArray = landArray; 

1andArray.push!"Australia"); // this also adds "Australia” to continentList 

To create a copy of an array that is independent of another array: 

• Use the Array object’s slice!) method. 

For example, the following statements create an array and then use slice!) to make an 
independent copy of the array. 

// JavaScript syntax 

var oldArray = ["a", "b", "c"]; 

var newArray = oldArray.siice(); // makes an independent copy of oldArray 
After newArray is created, editing either ol dArray or newArray has no effect on the other. 


46 Chapter 2: Director Scripting Essentials 



Sorting arrays 

Arrays are sorted in alphanumeric order, with numbers being sorted before strings. Strings are 
sorted according to their initial letters, regardless of how many characters they contain. 

To sort an array: 

• Use the Array object’s sort!) method. 

The following statements sort a non-sorted alphabetical array. 

// JavaScript syntax 

var oldArray = ["d", "a", "c", "b"]; 

oldArray.sort(); // results in a, b, c, d 

The following statements sort a non-sorted alphanumeric array. 

// JavaScript syntax 

var oldArray = [6, "f", 3, "b"]; 

oldArray.sort(); // results in 3, 6, b, f 

Sorting an array results in a new sorted array. 

Creating multidimensional arrays 

You can also create multidimensional arrays that enable you to work with the values of more than 
one array at a time. 

In the following example, the first two statements create the separate arrays arrayl and array2. 
The third statement creates a multidimensional array and assigns it to mdArray. To access the 
values in a multidimensional array, the fourth and fifth statements use brackets to access the 
values in the array; the first bracket provides access to a specified array, and the second bracket 
provides access to value at a specified index position in the array. 

// JavaScript syntax 

var arrayl = new Array(5,10); 

var array2 = [15,20]; 

var mdArray = new Arraylarrayl, array2); 

trace(mdArray[0][1]); // displays 10 

tracetmdArray[1][0]); // displays 15

CHAPTER 3 

Writing Scripts in Director 


Scripts in Macromedia Director MX 2004 support all kinds of functionality in movies that would 
not be possible otherwise. As you write scripts, you may find the need for increasingly advanced 
scripts to support complex interactivity in your Director movies. Intermediate and advanced 
scripting concepts and techniques are presented here, including information about object- 
oriented scripting in Director. 

If you are new to scripting in Director, make sure to read Chapter 2, “Director Scripting 
Essentials,” on page 9 in addition to the topics here. 

Choosing between Lingo and JavaScript syntax 

Both Lingo and JavaScript syntax provide access to the same objects, events, and scripting APIs. 
Therefore, it does not necessarily matter which language you choose to write your scripts. Your 
choice might be as simple as deciding which language you have the most knowledge of and are 
most comfortable with. 

To understand how scripting languages typically work with a given object and event model in 
Director, consider the following: 

• In general, a given scripting language, such as Lingo or JavaScripts syntax, is wrapped around a 
given object and event model in order to provide access to those objects and events. 

• JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard that is wrapped around a web 
browsers object and event model to provide access to the browser’s objects and events. 

• ActionScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard that is wrapped around the 
Macromedia Flash object and event model to provide access to Flash objects and events. 

• The Director implementation of JavaScript syntax is an implementation of ECMAScript that 
is wrapped around the Director object and event model to provide access to Director objects 
and events. 

• Lingo is a custom syntax that is wrapped around the Director object and event model to 
provide access to Director objects and events. 

Lingo and JavaScript syntax are the two languages you can use to access the same Director object 
and event model. Scripts written in one language have the same capabilities as scripts written in 
the other language. 


49 



Therefore, after you know how to access the scripting APIs in one language, you essentially know 
how to access them in the other language. For example, JavaScript syntax code can access Lingo 
data types such as symbols, linear lists, property lists, and so on, create and invoke Lingo parent 
scripts and behaviors, create and invoke Xtra extensions, and use Lingo string chunk expressions. 
Also, both JavaScript syntax and Lingo scripts can be used within a single movie; however, a single 
script cast member can contain only one syntax or the other. 

There are two main differences between Lingo and JavaScript syntax: 

• Each language contains some terminology and syntax conventions that are unique to each 
language. For example, the syntax for an event handler is different in Lingo than it is in 
JavaScript syntax: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown 

end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDownO { 


For more information on the terminology and syntax conventions used for each language, see 
“Scripting terminology” on page 10 and “Scripting syntax” on page 12. 

• Some of the scripting APIs are accessed slightly differently in each language. For example, 
you would use different constructs to access the second word in the first paragraph of a text 
cast member: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("News Items").paragraph[l].word[2] 

// JavaScript syntax 

memberC'News Items"). getPropRef( "paragraph", 1). getProp( "word”, 2); 

Scripting in dot syntax format 

Whether you write scripts in Lingo or JavaScript syntax, you write them by using the dot syntax 
format. You use dot syntax to access the properties or methods related to an object. A dot syntax 
statement begins with a reference to an object, followed by a period (dot), and then the name of 
the property, method, or text chunk that you want to specify. Each dot in a statement essentially 
represents a move from a higher, more general level in the object hierarchy to a lower, more 
specific level in the object hierarchy. 

For example, the following statement first creates a reference to the cast library named "News 
Stories", and then uses dot syntax to access the number of cast members in that cast library. 

-- Lingo syntax 

cast Lib("News Stories").member.count 

// JavaScript syntax 

cast Lib("News Stories").member.count; 


50 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



To identify chunks of text, include terms after the dot to refer to more specific items within text. 
For example, the first statement below refers to the first paragraph of the text cast member named 
"News Items". The second statement below refers to the second word in the first paragraph. 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("News Items").paragraph[l] 
member!"News Items").paragraph[l].word[2] 

// JavaScript syntax 

memberC'News Items").getPropRef!"paragraph", 1); 

memberC'News Items").getPropRef("paragraph", 1).getProp!"word", 2); 

For certain objects that handle cascading property access to either data or a specific cast member 
type, as illustrated in the previous two statements, access to the properties is not supported by 
using normal JavaScript syntax. Therefore, you must use the getPropRef () and getProp!) 
methods to access cascading properties in JavaScript syntax. 

There are a few things to note about this JavaScript syntax exception: 

• This technique must be applied to 3D objects, text cast members, field cast members, and 
XML Parser Xtra extensions accessed by using JavaScript syntax. 

• You must use the getPropRef!) method to store a reference to one of the previously 
mentioned objects or its properties by using JavaScript syntax. 

• You must use the get Prop! ) method to retrieve a property value of one of the previously 
mentioned objects or its properties by using JavaScript syntax. 

• 3D objects and properties must be accessed by using their fully qualified names in JavaScript 
syntax. For example, in Lingo, the property shader can be used as a shortcut for the property 
shaderList[l], However, in JavaScript syntax, the property shaderList[l] must be used at 
all times. 

Introducing the Director objects 

In basic terms, objects are logical groupings of named data that also can contain methods that act 
on that data. In this release of Director, the scripting APIs have been grouped into objects and are 
accessed through these objects. Each object provides access to a specific set of named data and 
type of functionality. For example, the Sprite object provides access to the data and functionality 
of a sprite, the Movie object provides access to the data and functionality of a movie, and so on. 

The objects used in Director fall into the following four categories. Depending on the type of 
functionality you want to add and the part of a movie you are adding functionality to, you will 
use the objects from one or more of these categories: 

• Core objects 

• Media types 

• Scripting objects 

• 3D objects 


Introducing the Director objects 51 



Core objects 

This category of objects provides access to the core functionality and features available in 
Director, such as the Director player engine, movie windows, sprites, sounds, and so on. They 
represent the base layer through which all APIs and other object categories are accessed. 

There are also a group of top-level methods and properties that enable you to access all of the core 
objects directly, instead of having to traverse the object hierarchy to access a specific core object. 

For a reference of the available core objects and their APIs, see Chapter 5, “Director Core 
Objects,” on page 101. 

Media types 

This category of objects provides access to the functionality of the various media types, such as 
RealMedia, DVD, Animated GIF, and so on, which are added to movies as cast members. 

Literally, media types are not actually objects, but rather cast members that are of a specific type 
of media. When a media type is added to a movie as a cast member, it not only inherits the 
functionality of the core Member object, it also extends the Member object by providing 
additional functionality that is available only to the specified media type. For example, a 
RealMedia cast member has access to the Member object’s methods and properties, but it also has 
additional methods and properties that are specific to RealMedia. All other media types also 
exhibit this behavior. 

For a reference of the available media types and their APIs, see Chapter 6, “Media Types,” 
on page 119. 

Scripting objects 

This category of objects, also known as Xtra extensions, provides access to the functionality of the 
software components, such as XML Parser, Fileio, SpeechXtra, and so on, that are installed with 
Director and extend core Director functionary. The preexisting Xtra extensions provide 
capabilities such as importing filters and connecting to the Internet. If you know the C 
programming language, you can create your own custom Xtra extensions. 

For a reference of the available scripting objects and their APIs, see Chapter 7, “Scripting 
Objects,” on page 137. 

3D objects 

This category of objects provides access to the functionality of the cast members and text that are 
used to create 3D movies. 

For more information about 3D movies, see the Using Director topics in the Director Fdelp Panel. 

For a reference of the available 3D objects and their APIs, see Chapter 8, “3D Objects,” 
on page 141.

Top level functions and properties 

There are a number of top level functions and properties that provide direct access to the core 
objects and functionality in Director. You will likely make extensive use of many of these 
functions and properties as you create references to core objects, new images, lists, and so on. For 
example, the top level _movi e property refers directly to the core Movie object, and the top level 
1 i st () function creates a linear list. 

The following tables list the top level functions and properties.

Introduction to object-oriented programming in Director 

By using either Lingo or JavaScript syntax, you can apply object-oriented programming principles 
to your scripts. Applying object-oriented principles typically makes programming easier by letting 
you write less code and letting you use simpler logic to accomplish tasks, in addition to increasing 
the reusability and modularity of your code. 

Depending on the scripting language you are using, you apply these principles using two 
different paradigms: 

• In Lingo, you use parent scripts, ancestor scripts, and child objects to simulate object-oriented 
programming. 

• In JavaScript syntax, you use standard JavaScript-style object-oriented programming 
techniques to create classes and subclasses. 


54 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 









Each paradigm enables you to apply the advantages of object-oriented programming to your 
scripts, so it does not really matter which scripting language you are using. You merely apply the 
principles in different ways. 

Because each scripting language uses a different paradigm to apply object-oriented principles, the 
techniques described for one language won’t work in the other language. Therefore, you only

Object-oriented programming with Lingo 

In Lingo, parent scripts provide the advantages of object-oriented programming. You can use 
parent scripts to generate script objects that behave and respond similarly yet can still operate 
independently of each other. 

You can create multiple copies (or instances) of a parent script by using Lingo. Each instance of a 
parent script is called a child object. You can create child objects on demand as the movie plays. 
Director does not limit the number of child objects that can be created from the same parent 
script. You can create as many child objects as the computer’s memory can support. 

Director can create multiple child objects from the same parent script, just as Director can create 
multiple instances of a behavior for different sprites. You can think of a parent script as a template 
and of child objects as implementations of the parent template. 

The discussion about Lingo parent scripts and child objects describes the basics of how to write 
parent scripts and create and use child objects, and also provides script examples. It does not teach 
fundamental object-oriented programming concepts; however, to use parent scripts and child 
objects successfully, you must understand object-oriented programming principles. For an 
introduction to the basics of object-oriented programming, see one of the many third-party 
resources on that subject. 

Similarity to other object-oriented languages 

If you are familiar with an object-oriented programming language such as Java or C++, you may 
already understand the concepts that underlie parent scripting but know them by different names. 

Terms that Director uses to describe parent scripts and child objects correspond to the following 
common object-oriented programming terms: 

Parent scripts in Director correspond to classes in object-oriented programming. 

Child objects in Director correspond to instances in object-oriented programming. 

Property variables in Director correspond to instance variables or member variables in object- 
oriented programming. 

Handlers in Director correspond to methods in object-oriented programming. 

Ancestor scripts in Director correspond to the Super class or base class in object-oriented 
programming.

Parent script and child object basics 

In Lingo, a parent script is a set of handlers and properties that define a child object; it is not a 
child object itself. A child object is a self-contained, independent instance of a parent script. 
Children of the same parent have identical handlers and properties, so child objects in the same 
group can have similar responses to events and messages. 

Typically, parent scripts are used to build child objects that make it easier to organize movie logic. 
These child objects are especially useful when a movie requires the same logic to be run several 
times concurrently with different parameters. You can also add a child object to a Sprite object’s 
scri ptlnstanceLi st or the Movie object’s actorLi st as a way to control animation. 

Because all the child objects of the same parent script have identical handlers, those child objects 
respond to events in similar ways. However, because each child object maintains independent 
values for the properties defined in the parent script, each child object can behave differently than 
its sibling objects—even though they are instances of the same parent script. 

For example, you can create a parent script that defines child objects that are editable text fields, 
each with its own property settings, text, and color, regardless of the other text fields’ settings. 

By changing the values of properties in specific child objects, you can change any of these 
characteristics as the movie plays without affecting the other child objects based on the same 
parent script. 

Similarly, a child object can have a property set to either TRUE or FALSE regardless of that 
property’s setting in sibling child objects. 

A parent script refers to the name of a script cast member that contains the property variables 
and handlers. A child object created from a parent script is essentially a new instance of the script 
cast member. 

Differences between child objects and behaviors 

While child objects and behaviors are similar in that they both can have multiple instances, they 
have some important differences as well. The main difference between child objects and behaviors 
is that behaviors are associated with locations in the Score because they are attached to sprites. 
Behavior objects are automatically created from initializers stored in the Score as the playhead 
moves from frame to frame and encounters sprites with attached behaviors. In contrast, child 
objects from parent scripts must be created explicitly by a handler. 

Behaviors and child objects differ in how they become associated with sprites. Director 
automatically associates a behavior with the sprite that the behavior is attached to, but you must 
explicitly associate a child object with a sprite. Child objects do not require sprite references and 
exist only in memory. 

Ancestor basics 

Parent scripts can declare ancestors, which are additional scripts whose handlers and properties a 
child object can call on and use. 

Ancestor scripting lets you create a set of handlers and properties that you can use and reuse for 
multiple parent scripts. 


56 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



A parent script makes another parent script its ancestor by assigning the script to its ancestor 
property. For example, the following statement makes the script What_Everyone_Does an 
ancestor to the parent script in which the statement occurs: 

-- Lingo syntax 

ancestor = newlscript "What_Everyone_Does") 

When handlers and properties are not defined in a child object, Director searches for the handler 
or property in the child’s ancestors, starting with the child’s parent script. If a handler is called or 
a property is tested and the parent script contains no definition for it, Director searches for a 
definition in the ancestor script. If a definition exists in the ancestor script, that definition is used. 

A child object can have only one ancestor at a time, but that ancestor script can have its own 
ancestor, which can also have an ancestor, and so on. This lets you create a series of parent scripts 
whose handlers are available to a child object. 

Writing a parent script 

A parent script contains the code needed to create child objects and define their possible actions 
and properties. First, you must decide how you want the child objects to behave. Then, you can 
write a parent script that does the following: 

• Optionally declares any appropriate property variables; these variables represent properties for 
which each child object can contain a value independent of other child objects. 

• Sets up the initial values of the child objects’ properties and variables in the on new handler. 

• Contains additional handlers that control the child objects’ actions. 

Declaring property variables 

Each child object created from the same parent script initially contains the same values for its 
property variables. A property variable’s value belongs only to the child object it’s associated with. 
Each property variable and its value persists as long as the child object exists. The initial value for 
the property variable is typically set in the on new handler; if it’s not set, the initial value is VOID. 

To declare a property variable: 

• Use the property keyword at the beginning of the parent script. 

To set and test property variables from outside the child object: 

• Set and test property variables in the same way you would any other property in your scripts, 
by using the syntax objectRef. propertyName. 

For example, the following statement sets the speed property of an object carl: 
carl.speed = 55 

Creating the new handler 

Each parent script typically uses an on new handler. This handler creates the new child object 
when another script issues a new( scri pt parentScriptName) command, which tells the 
specified parent script to create a child object from itself. The on new handler in the parent script 
can also set the child object’s initial property values, if you want. 

The on new handler always starts with the phrase on new , followed by the me variable and any 
parameters being passed to the new child object. 


Object-oriented programming with Lingo 57 



The following on new handler creates a new child object from the parent script and initializes the 
child’s spri teNum property with the value passed to it in the aSpri teNum parameter. The return 
me statement returns the child object to the handler that originally called the on new handler. 

-- Lingo syntax 
property spriteNum 

on new me, aSpriteNum 
spriteNum = aSpriteNum 
return me 
end 

For more information on calling the on new handlers, see “Creating a child object” on page 59. 

Adding other handlers 

You determine a child object’s behavior by including in the parent script the handlers that 
produce the desired behavior. For example, you could add a handler to make a sprite 
change color. 

The following parent script defines a value for the property spri teNum, and contains a second 
handler that changes the foreColor property of the sprite. 

-- Lingo syntax 
property spriteNum 

on new me, aSpriteNum 
spriteNum = aSpriteNum 
return me 
end 

on changeColor me 

spriteNum.foreColor = random(255) 
end 

Referring to the current object 

Typically, one parent script creates many child objects, and each child object contains more than 
one handler. The special parameter variable me tell the handlers in a child object that they are to 
operate on the properties of that object and not on the properties of any other child object. This 
way, when a handler within a child object refers to properties, the handler uses its own child 
object’s values for those properties. 

The term me must always be the first parameter variable stated in every handler definition in a 
parent script. It is always important to define me as the first parameter for parent scripts and to 
pass the same parameter if you need to call other handlers in the same parent script, since these 
will be the handlers in each of the script’s child objects. 

When referring to properties defined in ancestor scripts, you must use the me parameter as the 
source of the reference. This is because the property, while defined in the ancestor script, is 
nevertheless a property of the child object. For example, the following statement uses me to refer 
to an object and access properties defined in an ancestor of the object: 

-- Lingo syntax 

x = me.y -- access ancestor property y 

Because the variable me is present in each handler of a child object, it indicates that all the 
handlers control that same child object. 


58 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



Creating a child object 

Child objects exist entirely in memory; they are not saved with a movie. Only parent and ancestor 
scripts exist on disk. 

To create a new child object, you use the newO method and assign the child object a variable 
name or position in a list so you can identify and work with it later. 

To create a child object and assign it to a variable, use the following syntax. 

-- Lingo syntax 

i /ariabl eName = newlscript " scriptName ", parameterl, parameter2, ...) 

The scri ptName parameter is the name of the parent script, and parameterl , parameter2, . . . 
are any parameters you are passing to the child object’s on new handler. The new( ) method 
creates a child object whose ancestor is scri ptName. It then calls the on new handler in the child 
object with the specified parameters. 

You can issue a newO statement from anywhere in a movie. You can customize the child object’s 
initial settings by changing the values of the parameters passed with the newO statement. 

Each child object requires only enough memory to record the current values of its properties and 
variables and a reference to the parent script. Because of this, in most cases, you can create and 
maintain as many child objects as you require. 

You can produce additional child objects from the same parent script by issuing additional 
newO statements. 

You can create child objects without immediately initializing their property variables by using the 
rawNew( ) method. The rawNew! ) method does this by creating the child object without calling 
the parent script’s on new handler. In situations where large numbers of child objects are needed, 
rawNew( ) allows you to create the objects ahead of time and defer the assignment of property 
values until each object is needed. 

The following statement creates a child object from the parent script Car without initializing its 
property variables and assigns it to the variable carl: 

-- Lingo syntax 

carl = script!"Car").rawNew!) 

To initialize the properties of one of these child objects, call its on new handler: 

carl.new 

Checking child object properties 

You can check the values of specific property variables in individual child objects by using a 
simple objectName.propertyName syntax. For example, the following statement assigns the 
variable x the value of the ca rSpeed property of the child object in the variable carl: 

-- Lingo syntax 
x = carl.carSpeed 

Querying object properties from outside the objects themselves can be useful for getting 
information about groups of objects, such as the average speed of all the car objects in a racing 
game. You might also use the properties of one object to help determine the behavior of other 
objects that are dependent on it. 


Object-oriented programming with Lingo 59 





In addition to checking the properties that you assign, you can check whether a child object 
contains a specific handler or find out which parent script an object came from. This is useful 
when you have objects that come from parent scripts that are similar but that have subtle 
differences. 

For example, you may want to create a scenario in which one of several parent scripts might be 
used to create a child object. You can then determine which parent script a particular child object 
came from by using the script!) function, which returns the name of an objects parent script. 

The following statements check whether the object carl was created from the parent script 
named Car: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if carl.script = script("Car") then 
_sound.beep!) 
end i f 

You can also get a list of the handlers in a child object by using the handlers! ) method, or check 
whether a particular handler exists in a child object by using the handl er( ) method. 

The following statement places a list of the handlers in the child object carl into the variable 
myHandl erLi st: 

-- Lingo syntax 

myHandlerList = carl.handlers() 

The resulting list would look something like this: 

[#start, #accelerate, #stop] 

The following statements use the handler! ) method to check whether the handler o n 
accel erate exists in the child object carl: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if carl.handler(#accelerate) then 

putCThe child object carl contains the handler named on accelerate.") 
end i f 

Removing a child object 

You can remove a child object from a movie by setting all variables that contain a reference to the 
child object to another value. If the child object has been assigned to a list, such as actorLi st, 
you must also remove the child object from the list. 

To remove a child object and the variables that refer to it: 

• Set each variable to VOID. 

Director deletes the child object when there are no more references to it. In the following 
example, ba 111 contains the only reference to a specific child object, and it is set to VO ID to delete 
the object from memory. 

-- Lingo syntax 
balll = VOID 

To remove an object from actorList: 

• Use the delete! ) method to delete the item from the list. 


60 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



Using scriptlnstanceList 

You can use the scriptlnstanceList property to dynamically add new behaviors to a sprite. 
Normally, scriptlnstanceList is the list of behavior instances created from the behavior 
initializers defined in the Score. If you add child objects created from parent scripts to this list, the 
child objects receive the messages sent to other behaviors. 

For example, the following statement adds a child object to the scriptlnstanceList property 
of sprite 10: 

-- Lingo syntax 

add(sprite( 10 ).scriptInstanceList, new(script "rotation", 10)) 

The following is a possible parent script that the previous statement refers to: 

-- Lingo syntax parent script "rotation" 
property spriteNum 

on new me, aSpriteNum 
spriteNum = aSpriteNum 
return me 
end 

on prepareFrame me 

sprite(spriteNum).rotation = sprite(spriteNum).rotation + 1 
end 

When a child object is added to scri ptlnstanceLi st, you must initialize the child object’s 
spriteNum property. Typically, you do this from a parameter passed in to the on new handler. 

Note: The begi nSpri te message is not sent to dynamically added child objects. 

For reference information on scri ptlnstanceLi st, see “scriptlnstanceList” on page 964. 

Using actorList 

You can set up a special list of child objects (or any other objects) that receives its own message 
each time the playhead enters a frame or the updateStagel ) method updates the Stage. 

The special list is actorLi st, which contains only objects that have been explicitly added to 
the list. 

The message is the stepFrame message that is sent only when the playhead enters a frame or the 
updateStagel ) command is used. 

Objects in actorLi st receive a stepFrame message instead of an enterFrame message at each 
frame. If the objects have an on stepFrame handler available, the script in the handler runs each 
time the playhead enters a new frame or the updateStagef ) method updates the Stage. 

Some possible uses of actorLi st and stepFrame are to animate child objects that are used as 
sprites or to update a counter that tracks the number of times the playhead enters a frame. 

An on enterFrame handler could achieve the same results, but the actorLi st property and 
stepFrame handler are optimized for performance in Director. Objects in actorList respond 
more efficiently to stepFrame messages than to enterFrame messages or custom messages sent 
after an updateStage( ) method. 


Object-oriented programming with Lingo 61 



To add an object to the actorList: 

• Use the actorLi st property as follows, where chi IdObject is a reference to the child object 
to add: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.actorList.add( chiIdObject ) 

The object’s stepFrame handler in its parent or ancestor script then runs automatically each 
time the playhead advances. The object is passed as the first parameter, me, to the on 
stepFrame handler. 

Director does not clear the contents of actorList when branching to another movie, which can 
cause unpredictable behavior in the new movie. If you do not want child objects in the current 
movie to be carried over into the new movie, insert a statement that clears actorList in the on 
prepareMovi e handler of the new movie. 

To clear child objects from actorList: 

• Set actorLi st to [ ], which is an empty list. 

For reference information on actorLi st, see “actorList” on page 621. 

Creating timeout objects 

A timeout object is a script object that acts like a timer and sends a message when the timer 
expires. This is useful for scenarios that require specific things to happen at regular time intervals 
or after a particular amount of time has elapsed. 

Timeout objects can send messages that call handlers inside child objects or in movie scripts. You 
create a timeout object by using the new() keyword. You must specify a name for the object, a 
handler to be called, and the frequency with which you want the handler to be called. After a 
timeout object is created, Director keeps a list of currently active timeout objects, called 
ti meOutLi st. 

To create timeout objects: 

• Use either syntax below: 

--Lingo syntax 

variableName = timeOut( timeOutObjName) .new( intMi11iseconds , tthandlerName \ 

I, targetObjectI) 

variableName = new timeOut (timeOutObjName, intMi11iseconds, fthandlerName \ 

I, targetObjectI) 

This statement uses the following elements: 

• vari abl eName is the variable you are placing the timeout object into. 

• ti meOut indicates which type of Lingo object you are creating. 

• timeOutObjName is the name you give to the timeout object. This name appears in the 
ti meOutLi st. It is the #name property of the object. 

• new creates a new object. 

• intMi 11 iseconds indicates the frequency with which the timeout object should call the 
handler you specify. This is the #peri od property of the object. For example, a value of 2000 
calls the specified handler every 2 seconds. 


62 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



• fthandl erName is the name of the handler you want the object to call. This is the 

#ti meOutHandi er property of the object. You represent it as a symbol by preceding the name 
with the # sign. For example, a handler called on accelerate would be specified as 
#accel erate. 

• targetObject indicates which child object’s handler should be called. This is the #targe| 
property of the object. It allows specificity when many child objects contain the same handlers. 
If you omit this parameter, Director looks for the specified handler in the movie script. 

The following statement creates a timeout object named timerl that calls an on accel erate 
handler in the child object carl every 2 seconds: 

-- Lingo syntax 

myTimer = timeOut("timerl").new(2000, #accelerate, carl) 

To determine when the next timeout message will be sent from a particular timeout object, check 
its #ti me property. The value returned is the point in time, in milliseconds, when the next 
timeout message will be sent. For example, the following statement determines the time when 
the next timeout message will be sent from the timeout object timerl and displays it in the 
Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(timeout!"timerl").time) 

Using timeOutList 

When you begin creating timeout objects, you can use ti meOutLi st to check the number of 
timeout objects that are active at a particular moment. 

The following statement sets the variable x to the number of objects in ti meOutLi st by using the 
count property. 

-- Lingo syntax 
x = _movie.timeout List.count 

You can also refer to an individual timeout object by its number in the list. 

The following statement deletes the second timeout object in ti meOut Li st by using the 
forget( ) method. 

-- Lingo syntax 
timeout(2).forget() 

Relaying system events with timeout objects 

When you create timeout objects that target specific child objects, you enable those child objects 
to receive system events. Timeout objects relay these events to their target child objects. The 
system events that can be received by child objects include prepareMovi e, startMovie, 
stopMovi e, prepareFrame, and exi tFrame. By including handlers for these events in child 
objects, you can make the child objects respond to them for whatever purposes you see fit. System 
events received by child objects are also received by movie scripts, frame scripts, and other scripts 
designed to respond to them. 


Object-oriented programming with Lingo 63 



The following parent script contains a handler for the system event exi tFrame and a custom 
handler si owDown. 

-- Lingo syntax 
property velocity 

on new me 

velocity = random(55) 
end 

on exitFrame 

velocity = velocity + 5 
end 

on siowDown mph 

velocity = velocity - mph 
end 

Associating custom properties with timeout objects 

If you want to associate custom properties with a timeout object, you may want to create a 
timeout object that uses as a target anything other than a reference to a script instance object. 
When you use this technique, the target data becomes data that is associated with the timeout 
object, and can be used in your timeout handler. 

The following example illustrates using this technique. 

-- Lingo syntax 

-- initialize a timeout object and pass it a data property list (tData) 

-- instead of a reference to a script instance object 
tData = [#beta: 0] 

tTO = timeout!"betaData").new(50,(/targetHandler,tData) 

-- within a movie script, create the targetHandler handler 
on targetHandler (aData) 

-- increment and display the beta property 
tData.beta = tData.beta + 1 
put(tData.beta) 
end targetHandler 

In the previous example, the beta property keeps incrementing. This means that you can 
initialize several timeout objects that all call the same movie script handler, and each timeout 
object can have its own data list associated with it. 

In general, keep the following in mind: 

• When using a reference to a script instance as a target, the target handler in that particular 
script instance is called. This technique does now allow the use of custom properties. 

• When using a reference to anything other than a script instance (such as a property list) as a 
target, the target handler in a movie script is called. This technique allows the use of custom 
properties. 


64 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



Object-oriented programming with JavaScript syntax 

Object-oriented programming in JavaScript syntax is somewhat different than it is in other 
object-oriented languages such as Java and C++—while some object-oriented languages are class- 
based, JavaScript syntax is prototype-based. 

The following two bullet points compare and contrast, at a high level, class-based languages with 
prototype-based languages such as JavaScript syntax. 

• In class-based languages, you create class definitions that define the initial properties and 
methods that characterize all instances created from those classes. A class definition contains 
special methods, called constructor methods, that are used to create the instances of that class. 
When an instance is created by using the new operator in association with a particular 
constructor method, that instance inherits all the properties of its parent class. That instance 
can also perform other processing specific to that instance depending on the constructor that 
was called. 

In a class definition, you perform inheritance by creating a subclass that inherits all the 
properties of its parent class, in addition to defining new properties and optionally modifying 
inherited ones. The parent class from which a subclass is created is also known as a super-class. 

• In prototype-based languages, such as JavaScript syntax, there is no distinction between classes, 
instances, subclasses, and so on—they are all known as objects. Instead of using class 
definitions, in JavaScript syntax you use "prototype objects" as the template from which new 
objects are created. Similar to class-based languages, in JavaScript syntax, you create a new 
object by using the new operator in association with a constructor function. 

Instead of using super-classes and subclasses, in JavaScript syntax, you associate prototype 
objects with constructor functions to perform inheritance. This process is very similar to using 
super-classes and subclasses, only with different terminology. 

Also, as opposed to class-based languages, in JavaScript syntax you can add and remove 
properties from an object or set of objects at runtime. For example, if you add a property to a 
prototype object at runtime, any instance objects for which it is a prototype also get that 
property. 

Object-oriented terminology 

Because all types in JavaScript syntax are known as objects, class-based terms such as super-class, 
subclass, class, instance, and so on do not have literal technical meanings in JavaScript syntax. 
However, all of these terms essentially map to objects in JavaScript syntax, and are convenient to 
use generically when referring to the different types of JavaScript syntax objects. Therefore, these 
class-based terms are used interchangeably with object throughout the discussion about object- 
oriented programming in JavaScript syntax to mean the following: 

• superclass Any class from which subclasses (objects) are created; a parent class. 

• subclass Any class that has been created from a superclass (object); a child class. 

• class A generic term for a superclass or subclass; a parent or child class. 

• instance or object instance A single object that has been created from a superclass. 


Object-oriented programming with JavaScript syntax 65 



Custom classes 

One of the major advantages of object-oriented programming is the ability to create your own 
custom classes that enable you to add custom functionality to your scripts. The predefined classes 
provided by JavaScript syntax, such as Object, String, Math, and so on are useful in some cases, 
but they may not provide the functionality you require to accomplish your task. For example, 
suppose you want some objects in your movie to represent types of transportation, such as cars, 
boats, planes, and so on, and that you want each category to exhibit unique characteristics and 
functionality. Neither the predefined JavaScript syntax classes nor the predefined Director objects 
may directly provide the functionality that you need. Therefore, you may want to create a new 
class for each type of transportation so you can define unique characteristics for each type. 

Keep in mind that when you create custom JavaScript syntax classes, you still have access to all the 
features and functionality of the predefined Director objects. This means that although the 
predefined Director objects may not directly provide the functionality that you need, you can still 
use them in your custom classes to access their values and predefined functionality. 

Constructor functions 

In JavaScript syntax, a constructor function represents the class that contains the template from 
which new object instances are created. Constructor functions create and initialize (set the default 
state of) properties in the new objects. 

Constructor functions are essentially identical in format to regular JavaScript syntax method 
functions. The difference between a constructor function and a method function is that a 
constructor function uses the special this keyword to represent a reference to the new object that 
is being initialized. A method function typically only performs some action on a given set of an 
object’s data. 

The following example illustrates one way to create a Rectangle constructor function that could 
be used to initialize the height and width of new Rectangle objects. 

function Rectangletw, h) { 
this .width = w; 
this.height = h; 

1 

You can also create a constructor function by using "function literal" syntax. Function literal 
syntax provides the same functionality as the syntax used previously, and is merely an alternative 
way to write the constructor. The following example illustrates using function literal syntax to 
create a Rectangle constructor function similar to the one illustrated previously. 

Rectangle = functiontw, h) { 
this .width = w; 
this.height = h; 

1 

Note: When defining constructor functions that apply to a movie, be sure to place them in a movie 
script so they are available globally. 

It is considered good scripting practice to give constructor functions names that map to their 
functionality, and to use initial capitalization in their names, such as Rectangle or Circle. 

Constructor functions are typically used only to initialize new objects, but can also return the 
object if desired. If you do return the initialized object, the returned object becomes the value of 
the new expression. 


66 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



Object instances 

The most common way to create a new object instance is to use the new operator followed by the 
name of a constructor function. The following examples create new object instances. 

var objRandom = new Object!); // assigns a reference to an Object object 
var objString = new String!); // assigns a reference to a String object 

A constructor function can optionally define parameters that a new object instance passes to it to 
initialize the state of the object instance. If a constructor function does define parameters used 
during initialization of new object instances, the property values are initialized as follows; 

• If you pass values to the constructor function during initialization, the properties that received 
values are set to those values. 

• If you do not pass values to the constructor function during initialization, the properties that 
did not receive values are set to undefined. 

When you create new object instances, the keyword this is used in the body of the associated 
constructor function to refer to the new object instance. Therefore, a new object instance is 
initialized with all of the properties defined by using the this, property Name syntax. 

In the following example, a Ci rcl e constructor function uses the keyword this to specify the 
names of three properties that will be associated with new object instances. The statement 
following the constructor initializes a new object instance by passing values to the constructor. 
These values are used as the initial values of the properties specified by the keyword this. 

// Circle constructor function 
function Circle(x, y, r) { 
this.xCoord = x; 
this .yCoord = y; 
this, radius = r; 

1 


// xCoord = 10, yCoord = 15, radius = 5 
var objCircle = new CircledO, 15, 5); 

Now that objCi rcl e has been initialized, you can access its properties. Using the objCi rcl e 
instance created previously, you could set some variables equal to the values of its properties. 

var theXCoord = objCircle.xCoord; it assigns the value 10 to theXCoord 

var theYCoord = objCircle.yCoord; it assigns the value 15 to theYCoord 

var theRadius = objCircle.radius; // assigns the value 5 to theRadius 

Note: For more information on using dot syntax to access properties and methods of an object, see 
“Scripting in dot syntax format” on page 50. 

It is considered good scripting practice to give new objects names that map to their functionality, 
and to name them by using lowercase letters, such as ob j Rectangle or objCi rcl e. 

You can also create an object instance by using "object literal" syntax, which eliminates the need 
for the new operator and a constructor function. You typically only use this technique when you 
need only one instance of an object that has not been defined in a constructor function. The 
following example creates an object instance with x = 1, y = 2, and radius = 2. 

var objSmal1Circle = { x:l, y:2, radius:2 ); 


Object-oriented programming with JavaScript syntax 67 



Object inheritance 

In addition to being able to create your own custom classes, another major advantage of object- 
oriented programming is the ability of subclasses to inherit the properties and methods of the 
superclasses from which they were created. Inheritance enables you to easily create objects that 
already have built-in properties and functionality. 

In JavaScript syntax, there is one superclass that acts as the base class from which all other 
subclasses are created—the Object superclass. The Object superclass contains a few basic 
properties and methods. The subclasses that are created by using Object as a template always 
inherit these basic properties and methods, and likely define their own properties and methods. 
Subclasses of these classes inherit from Object, from their superclasses, and so on. All additional 
objects that you create would continue this chain of inheritance. 

For example, Object contains the constructor property and the toStringO method. If you 
create a new class named SubOb j 1, it is a subclass of Object, and therefore automatically inherits 
the constructor property and the toStri ng( ) method of Object. If you then create another 
class named SubOb j 2 using SubOb jl as a superclass, SubOb j 2 would also inherit the 
constructor property and the toStri ng( ) method of Object, in addition to any custom 
properties and methods you defined in SubOb j 1. 

Two of the important properties that your custom constructor functions inherit from the Object 
superclass are prototype and constructor. The prototype property represents the prototype 
object of a class, which enables you to add variables (properties) and methods to object instances, 
and is the means by which inheritance is typically implemented in JavaScript syntax. The 
constructor property represents the constructor function itself. The use of these properties is 
explained in the following sections. 

Prototype objects 

As previously stated, when you create a subclass, it automatically inherits the properties and 
methods of the superclass on which it is based. In JavaScript syntax, inheritance is typically 
implemented by using prototype objects. A subclass actually inherits its properties and methods 
from the prototype object of its superclass, and not from the superclass itself. This important 
point offers a distinct advantage: all properties and methods do not literally have to be copied 
from a class to an object instance of that class, which can dramatically decrease the amount of 
memory required by new object instances. 

Every class in JavaScript syntax, including the predefined Object class, contains only one 
prototype object. Every object instance created from a class has access to the properties and 
methods in the prototype object of that class. Therefore, the prototype object of a class is typically 
the only object that actually stores the properties and methods for that class; an object instance 
only contains the properties required to initialize that instance. 

In your code, it appears that each object instance actually contains those properties and methods 
because you can access them directly from each object instance, but the instance is actually using 
the prototype object to access them. The prototype object of a class is created automatically when 
you create the class. You access the prototype object by using the prototype property of the class. 

Because a prototype object of a class stores properties that are shared by all object instances, they 
are ideally suited to define properties and methods whose values will be shared across all object 
instances. By sharing properties and methods across object instances, you can easily create 
instances that exhibit a defined default behavior, and can also customize any instances that deviate 
from the default behavior. 


68 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



Prototype objects typically are not suited to define properties and methods whose values may vary 
across object instances. In cases where values may vary across object instances, you typically define 
those properties and methods within the class itself. 

To specify the scope of a custom property or method, you define it as one of the following 
four types: 

• Instance variables 

• Instance methods 

• Class variables 

• Class methods 

Instance variables 

Instance variables are any variables (properties) that are defined in a constructor function and that 
are copied into each object instance of that constructor. All object instances have their own copies 
of instance variables. This means that if there are five object instances of a Ci rcl e class, there are 
five copies of each instance variable defined in the class. Because each object instance has its own 
copy of an instance variable, each object instance can assign a unique value to an instance variable 
without modifying the values of other copies of the instance variable. You access instance variables 
directly from their containing object instances. 

The following example defines four instance variables— make, model, col or, and speed —in a 
constructor function. These four instance variables are available directly from all object instances 
of the Car constructor. 

function Carlmake, model, color) 1 // define a Car class 
this.make = make; 
this.model = model; 
this, col or = col or; 
this .speed = 0; 

1 

The following object instance ob jCa r contains all four instance variables. Although a value for 
the instance variable speed is not passed to the Car constructor, objCa r still has a speed property 
whose initial value is 0 because the speed variable is defined in the Car constructor. 

// objCar.make="Subaru", objCar.model="Forester", 

// objCar.color="si1ver", objCar.speed = 0 

var objCar = new Cart"Subaru", "Forester", "silver"); 

Instance methods 

Instance methods are any methods that are accessible through an object instance. Object instances 
do not have their own copies of instance methods. Instead, instance methods are first defined as 
functions, and then properties of the constructor function’s prototype object are set to the 
function values. Instance methods use the keyword this in the body of the defining constructor 
function to refer to the object instance they are operating on. Although a given object instance 
does not have a copy of an instance method, you still access instance methods directly from their 
associated object instances. 


Object-oriented programming with JavaScript syntax 69 



The following example defines a function named Ca r_i ncreaseSpeedO. The function name is 
then assigned to the i ncreaseSpeed property of the Car class’s prototype object. 

// increase the speed of a Car 
function Car_increaseSpeed(x) { 
this.speed += x; 
return this.speed; 

1 

Car.prototype.increaseSpeed = Car_increaseSpeed; 

An object instance of Car could then access the i ncreaseSpeed () method and assign its value to 
a variable by using the following syntax. 

var objCar = new Car("Subaru", "Forester", "silver"); 
var newSpeed = objCar.increaseSpeed(30); 

You can also create an instance method by using function literal syntax. Using function literal 
syntax eliminates the need to define a function, and the need to assign a property name to the 
function name. 

The following example uses function literal syntax to define an increaseSpeedO method that 
contains the same functionality as the i ncreaseSpeed! ) function defined previously. 

// increase the speed of a Car 
Car.prototype.increaseSpeed = function(x) { 
this.speed += x; 
return this.speed; 

1 


Class variables 

Also known as static variables, these are any variables (properties) that are associated with a class, 
and not an object instance. There is always only one copy of a class variable, regardless of the 
number of object instances that are created from that class. Class variables do not use the 
prototype object to implement inheritance. You access a class variable directly through the class, 
and not through an object instance; you must define a class in a constructor function before you 
can define class variables. 

The following example defines two class variables— MAX_SPEED and MIN_SPEED. 
function Car!) { // define a Car class 


Car.MAX_SPEED = 165; 

Car.MIN_SPEED = 45; 

You would access the MAX_SPEED and MIN_SPEED class variables directly from the Car class. 

var carMaxSpeed = Car.MAX_SPEED; // carMaxSpeed = 165 

var carMinSpeed = Car.MIN_SPEED; // carMinSpeed = 45 

Class methods 

Also known as static methods, these are any methods that are associated with a class, and not an 
object instance. There is always only one copy of a class method, regardless of the number of 
object instances that are created from that class. Class methods do not use the prototype object to 
implement inheritance. You access a class method directly through the class, and not through 
an object instance; you must define a class in a constructor function before you can define 
class methods. 


70 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



The following example defines a function named setlnitialSpeedt) that can change the 
default speed of new car instances. The function name is assigned to the set I n i t i a 1 Speed 
property of the Car class. 

function Car(make, model, color) { // define a Car class 
this.make = make; 
this.model = model; 
this, col or = col or; 
this.speed = Car.defaultSpeed; 

1 

Car.defaultSpeed = 10; // initial speed for new Car instances 
// increase the speed of a Car 
function Car_setlnitialSpeed(x) { 

Car.defaultSpeed = x; 

1 

Car.setlnitialSpeed = Car_setlnitialSpeed; 

You access the setlni ti al Speed!) class method directly from the Car class, 
var newSpeed = Car.set InitialSpeed!30); 

You can also create a class method by using function literal syntax. The following example uses 
function literal syntax to define a setlni tialSpeed!) method that contains the same 
functionality as the setlni tialSpeed!) function defined previously. 

// increase the speed of a Car 
Car.setlnitialSpeed = function(x) { 

Car.defaultSpeed = x; 

1 


Recommended steps for defining a class 

The following list describes the recommended steps to follow when defining a class: 

1 Define a constructor function that is used as the template from which all object instances are 
initialized. You may additionally define any instance variables in the constructor function by 
using the keyword this to refer to an object instance. 

2 Define any instance methods, and possibly additional instance variables, that are stored in the 
prototype object of a class. These instance methods and variables are available to all object 
instances, and are accessible through the prototype object of the class. 

3 Define any class methods, class variables, and constants that are stored in the class itself. These 
class methods and variables are accessible only through the class itself. 

In your code, when you access a property of an object instance, JavaScript syntax searches the 
object instance itself for that property. If the instance does not contain the property, JavaScript 
syntax then searches the prototype object of the super-class from which the instance was created. 
Because an object instance is searched before the prototype object of the class from which it was 
created, object instance properties essentially hide properties from the prototype object of their 
super-classes. This means that both an object instance and its super-class could realistically define 
a property with the same name but different values. 


Object-oriented programming with JavaScript syntax 71 



Deleting variables 

You can delete a class variable or an instance variable by using the delete operator. The following 
example illustrates this process. 

function Card { // define a Car constructor function 


1 

Car.color = "blue"; // define a color property for the Car class 

Car.prototype.engine = "V8"; // define an engine property for the prototype 

var objCar = new Card; 

tracetCar.color); // displays "blue" 
tracetobjCar.engine); // displays "V8" 

delete Car.color; 

delete Car.prototype.engine; 

trace(Car.color); // displays undefined 
tracetobjCar.engine); // displays undefined 

Accessing the constructor property of a prototype object 

When you define a class by creating a constructor function, JavaScript syntax creates a prototype 
object for that class. When the prototype object is created, it initially includes a constructor 
property that refers to the constructor function itself. You can use the constructor property of a 
prototype object to determine the type of any given object. 

In the following example, the constructor property contains a reference to the constructor 
function used to the create the object instance. The value of the constructor property is actually 
a reference to the constructor itself and not a string that contains the constructor’s name. 

function Card { // define a Car class 
// initialization code here 

1 

var myCar = new Card; // myCar.constructor == function Card () 

Creating properties dynamically 

Another advantage of using prototype objects to implement inheritance is that properties and 
methods that are added to a prototype object are automatically available to object instances. This 
is true even if an object instance was created before the properties or methods were added. 

In the following example, the col or property is added to the prototype object of a Ca r class after 
an object instance of Ca r has already been created. 

function Cartmake, model) I // define a Car class 
thi s.make = make; 
this.model = model; 

1 

var myCar = new Car("Subaru", "Forester"); // create an object instance 
tracetmyCar.color); // returns undefined 

// add the color property to the Car class after myCar was initialized 
Car.prototype.color = "blue"; 

tracetmyCar.color); // returns "blue" 


72 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



You can also add properties to object instances after the instances have been created. When you 
add a property to a specific object instance, that property is available only to that specific object 
instance. Using the myCar object instance created previously, the following statements add the 
color property to myCar after it has already been created. 

tracetmyCar.color); // returns undefined 

myCar.color = "blue"; // add the color property to the myCar instance 
tracelmyCar.color); // returns "blue" 

var secondCar = new CarC'Honda", "Accord"); // create a second object instance 
tracetsecondCar.color); // returns undefined 

Writing scripts in the Script window 

When you write scripts for a movie, the quantity and variety of scripts can be very large. Deciding 
which methods or properties to use, how to structure scripts effectively, and where scripts should 
be placed requires careful planning and testing, especially as the complexity of your movie grows. 

Before you begin writing scripts, formulate your goal and understand what you want to 
achieve. This is as important—and typically as time-consuming—as developing storyboards 
for your work. 

When you have an overall plan for the movie, you are ready to start writing and testing scripts. 
Expect this to take time. Getting scripts to work the way you want often takes more than one 
cycle of writing, testing, and debugging. 

The best approach is to start simple and test your work frequently. When you get one part of a 
script working, start writing the next part. This approach helps you identify bugs efficiently and 
ensures that your scripts are solid as they become more complex. 

When you write your scripts, you write them in the Script window in the Director user interface. 
The Script window provides a number of features that help you create and modify your scripts. 

To open the Script window, do one of the following: 

• Select Window > Script. 

• Double-click a script cast member in the Cast window. 



For information on alternative ways to create and open scripts, see “Performing common tasks” 
on page 79. 


Writing scripts in the Script window 73 














Setting Script window preferences 

You can change the font of text in the Script window and define different colors for various code 
components. To change the default font of text in the Script window and the color of various 
code elements, you use Script window preferences. Director automatically colors different types of 
code elements unless you turn off Auto Coloring. 

To set Script window preferences: 

1 Select Edit > Preferences > Script. 

2 To choose the default font, click the Font button and select settings from the Font dialog box. 

3 To choose the default color of text in the Script window, select a color from the Color menu. 

4 To choose the background color for the Script window, select a color from the Background 
color menu. 

5 To make new Script windows automatically color certain code elements, select Auto Coloring. 
This option is on by default. With Auto Coloring off, all text appears in the default color. 

6 To make new Script windows automatically format your scripts with proper indenting, select 
Auto Format. This option is on by default. 

Note: The auto coloring and auto formatting features do not apply to JavaScript syntax code. 
Therefore, if you are authoring scripts using JavaScript syntax, the Auto Coloring and Auto Format 
buttons in the Script window are disabled, and terms such as f uncti on, va r, and this will appear in 
the default text color. 

7 To make new Script windows display line numbers for your scripts, select Fine Numbering. 
This option is on by default. 

8 If Auto Coloring is on, select colors for the following code elements from the corresponding 
color menus: 

■ Keywords 

■ Comments 

■ Fiterals 

■ Custom (terms you define in your own code) 

9 To change the line number column background color, click the Fine Numbers color menu and 
choose a new color. 

10 To change the location of the Call Stack, Variable, and Watcher panes in the Debugger 
window, select left, top, right, or bottom from the Debugger Panes menu. 


74 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



Inserting common scripting terms 

The Script window provides pop-up menus of common scripting terms that you can use to insert 
statements in a script. The same menus also appear in the Message window. 



In both the Script window and the Message window, you can select which scripting syntax you 
want to use for a particular script. 

To select the scripting syntax: 

• From the Script Syntax pop-up menu, select either Lingo or JavaScript. 

After you select a scripting syntax, you enter code in the syntax you have chosen. If you try to 
compile a script in a syntax other than the one you chose, a script error occurs. 

When entering scripts in the Script window, you can comment out or uncomment either single 
or multiple lines of code by using the Comment or Uncomment buttons. Depending on which 
scripting syntax you have chosen, the Comment and Uncomment buttons display the correct 
comment markers for that syntax; Lingo uses double-hyphens (- -), and JavaScript syntax uses 
double-slashes (//). 

To comment code: 

• Highlight the line or lines of code you want to comment out, and click Comment. 

Note: When using the Comment button to comment out multiple lines of JavaScript syntax code, 
Director inserts double-slashes before each line. You can also comment out multiple lines of code by 
inserting /* before the first line of commented code and inserting */ after the last line of commented 
code, but you must do this manually. 

To uncomment code: 

• Highlight the line or lines of code that you want to remove comments from, and 
click Uncomment. 

Both the Script window and the Message window contain the following menus: 

• The Alphabetical Lingo menu lists every element in alphabetical order, except 3D Lingo. 

• The Categorized Lingo menu lists categories of elements according to the features they are 
often used for. It does not include 3D Lingo. 

• The Alphabetical 3D Lingo menu lists all 3D Lingo elements in alphabetical order. 


Writing scripts in the Script window 75 



















• The Categorized 3D Lingo menu lists categories of all 3D Lingo elements according to the 
features they are used for. 

• The Scripting Xtras pop-up menu includes the methods and properties of all scripting Xtra 
extensions found, regardless of whether they are Macromedia or third-party Xtra extensions. 

Note: The scripting Xtra extensions listed in the Scripting Xtras pop-up menu are only those that 
support the i nterfacet) method and whose names actually appear in the pop-up menu. Although 
some cast member media types such as 3D and DVD also support the interfacet) method, they do 
not appear in the Scripting Xtras pop-up menu because they are not implemented in Director as 
scripting Xtra extensions. 

When you select an element from the pop-up menus, Director inserts the element at the insertion 
point in the Script window. 

When an element requires additional parameters, placeholder names are included that indicate 
the additional required information. When more than one argument or parameter is required, the 
first one is highlighted for you, so all you must do is type to replace it. You must select and change 
the other parameters yourself. 

Some cast member types and scripting Xtra extensions provide scripting terms that do not appear 
in the pop-up menus. These member types and Xtra extensions often have their own 
documentation, and you can find some information from within Director. 

To display a list of available Xtra extensions: 

• Issue either put (_pi ayer. xtra Li st) or trace (_pi ayer. xtra Li st) in the Message window. 

To display a list of available scripting Xtra extensions: 

• Issue either put(_player.scriptingXtraList)ortrace(_player.scriptingXtraList) 
in the Message window. 

To display a list of methods and properties for an Xtra extension: 

• From the Scripting Xtras pop-up menu, point to an Xtra extension, and on the submenu, 
click put interface. The methods and properties for that Xtra extension appear in the Message 
window. 

Entering and editing text 

Entering and editing text in a Script window is similar to entering and editing text in any 
other field. 

The following are common editing tasks that you perform in the Script window: 

• To select a word, double-click the word. 

• To select an entire script, select Select All from the Edit menu. 

• To start a new line, enter a carriage return. 

• In Lingo, to wrap a long line of code with a continuation symbol, press Alt+Enter (Windows) 
or Option+Return (Macintosh) where you want to insert a soft line break. The continuation 
symbol (\) that appears indicates that the statement continues on the next line. 

In JavaScript syntax, to wrap a long line of code, insert a regular line break by pressing Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Macintosh). The Lingo continuation symbol causes a script error in 
JavaScript syntax scripts. 


76 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



• To locate a handler in the current script, select the handler’s name from the Go to Handler 
pop-up menu in the Script window. 

• To compile any modified scripts, click the Script window’s Recompile All Modified Scripts 
button or close the Script window. When you modify a Script, an asterisk appears in the Script 
window title bar, indicating that the script needs to be recompiled. 

• To compile all scripts in a movie, select Recompile All Scripts from the Control menu. 

• To reformat a script with proper indentation, press Tab in the Script window. 

Director automatically indents statements when the syntax is correct. If a line does not indent 
properly, there is a problem in the syntax on that line. 

• To open a second Script window, Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Macintosh) the New 
Cast Member button in the Script window. This can be helpful for editing two different 
sections of a long script simultaneously. 

• To toggle line numbering, click the Line Numbering button. 

• To toggle Auto Coloring, click the Auto Coloring button. Auto coloring displays each type of 
Lingo element (properties, commands, and so on) in a different color. 

• To toggle Auto Formatting, click the Auto Format button. Auto Formatting adds the correct 
indenting to your scripts each time you add a carriage return or press Tab. 

Note: The auto coloring and auto formatting features do not apply to JavaScript syntax code. 
Therefore, if you are authoring scripts using JavaScript syntax, the Auto Coloring and Auto Format 
buttons in the Script window are disabled, and terms such as functi or, var, and this will appear in 
the default text color. 

Finding handlers and text in scripts 

The Find command in the Edit menu is useful for finding handlers and for finding and editing 
text and handlers. 

To find handlers in scripts: 

1 Select Edit > Find > Handler. 

The Find Handler dialog box appears. 

The left-most column in the Find Handler dialog box displays the name of each handler in 
the movie. The middle column displays the number of the cast member associated with the 
handler’s script, along with the name of that cast member. The rightmost column lists the cast 
library that contains the cast member. 

2 Select the handler that you want to find. 

3 Click Find. 

The handler appears in the Script window. 

The title bar at the top of the Script window indicates the script’s type. 


Writing scripts in the Script window 77 



To find text in scripts: 

1 Make the Script window active. 

2 Select Edit > Find > Text. 

The Find Text dialog box appears. 



3 Enter text that you want to find in the Find field, and then click Find. 

By default, find is not case-sensitive: ThisHandler, thisHandler, and THISHANDLER are all the 
same for search purposes. Click the Case Sensitive check box to make the find case-sensitive. 

To specify which cast members to search: 

• Select the appropriate option under Search: Scripts. 

To start the search over from the beginning after the search reaches the end: 

• Select the Wrap-Around option. 

To search only for whole words and not fragments of other words that match the word: 

• Select the Whole Words Only option. 

To find the next occurrence of the text specified in the Find field: 

• Select Edit > Find Again. 

To find occurrences of selected text: 

1 Select the text. 

2 Select Edit > Find > Selection. 


78 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 















Performing common tasks 

The following are ways to perform common tasks for creating, attaching, and opening scripts. 

To create a frame behavior (script attached to a frame): 

• Double-click the behavior channel in the frame to which you want to attach the behavior. 



Behavior channels 


When you create a new behavior, the behavior receives the cast library number of the first 
available location in the current Cast window. 

When you create a new frame behavior, the Script window opens and already contains the Lingo 
on ex it Frame handler The first line contains on exitFrame, followed by a line with a blinking 
insertion point, and then a line with the word end. This makes it easy for you to quickly attach a 
common Lingo behavior to the frame. To make this handler work with JavaScript syntax, replace 
on exi tFrame with f uncti on exitFrameO {, and replace end with }. 



One of the most common frame behaviors is one that keeps the playhead looping in a single 
frame. This can be useful when you want your movie to keep playing in a single frame while 
waiting for the user to click a button or for a digital video or sound to finish playing. 

To keep the playhead in a single frame: 

• In a frame behavior, type the following statement on the line after the on exi tFrame (Lingo) 
or functi on exi tFrame( ) (JavaScript syntax) statement: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.go(_movie.frame) 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.go(_movie.frame); 

The Movie object’s frame property refers to the frame currently occupied by the playhead. This 
statement essentially tells the playhead to "go back to the frame you are currently in." 


Writing scripts in the Script window 79 



































To create a sprite behavior (script attached to a sprite): 

• In the Score or on the Stage, select the sprite that you’re attaching the behavior to. Then select 
Window > Behavior Inspector and select New Behavior from the Behavior pop-up menu. 

When you create a new sprite behavior, the Script window opens and already contains the Lingo 
on mouseUp handler. The first line contains the line on mouseUp, followed by a line with a 
blinking insertion point, and then a line with the word end. This makes it easy for you to quickly 
attach a common behavior to the sprite. To make this handler work with JavaScript syntax, 
replace on mouseUp with function mouseUpO {, and replace end with ). 

To open a behavior for editing: 

1 Double-click the behavior in the Cast window. 

The Behavior inspector opens. 

2 Click the Script Window icon in the Behavior inspector. 

The Script window displays the behavior. 

Alternatively, you can open the Script window and cycle through the scripts until you reach 
the behavior. 

To remove a behavior from a Score location: 

• Select the location and then delete the script from the list displayed in the Property inspector 
(Behavior tab). 

To attach existing behaviors to sprites or frames, do one of the following: 

• Drag a behavior from a cast to a sprite or frame in the Score or (for sprites) to a sprite on 
the Stage. 

• In the score, select the sprites or frames that you’re attaching the behavior to. Then 
select Window > Behavior Inspector and select the existing behavior from the Behavior 
pop-up menu. 

To create a movie script (script attached to a movie), do one of the following: 

• If the current script in the Script window is a movie script, click the New Script button in the 
Script window. (Clicking the New Script button always creates a script of the same type as the 
current script.) 

• If the current script in the Script window is not a movie script, click the New Script button 
and then change the new script’s type with the Script Type pop-up menu in the Script tab of 
the Property inspector. 

• If no sprites or scripts are selected in the cast, Score, or Stage, then open a new Script window; 
this creates a new movie script by default. 

To open a movie script or parent script for editing: 

• Double-click the script in the Cast window. 

To change a script’s type: 

1 Select the script in the Cast window or open it in the Script window. 

2 Click the Script tab of the Property inspector and select a script type from the Script Type 
pop-up menu. 


80 Chapter 3: Writing Scripts in Director 



To cycle through the scripts in the Script window: 

• Use the Previous Cast Member and Next Cast Member arrows at the top of the Script window 
to advance or back up to a script. 

To duplicate a script: 

• Select the script in the Cast window and select Duplicate from the Edit menu. 

To create a script that is attached automatically to every sprite made from a specific cast member, 
attach the script to the cast member itself. 

To create a script attached to a cast member or open an existing one, do one of the 
following: 

• Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Macintosh) on a cast member in the Cast window 
and select Cast Member Script from the context menu. 

• Select a cast member in the Cast window and then click the Cast Member Script button in the 
Cast window. 

Using linked scripts 

In addition to scripts stored as internal cast members, you can choose to keep scripts in external 
text files and link them to your Director movie. These linked scripts are similar to linked image or 
digital video files that you can import into Director movies. 

Advantages of using linked scripts include the following: 

• One person can work on the Director file while another works on the script. 

• You can easily exchange scripts with others. 

• You can control the scripts separately from the Director file in a source code control 
application such as Microsoft Visual SourceSafe or Perforce by Perforce Software. Applications 
such as this prevent multiple programmers working on the same Director project from 
overwriting each other’s work. 

Linked scripts are used by Director only during authoring. At runtime, Director projectors and 
Macromedia Shockwave Player use a special internal copy of the script data stored in the movie. 
This way, your linked scripts need not be distributed with your movies and cannot be copied by 
end users. 

To import a script as a linked text file: 

1 Select File > Import. 

2 Select Script as the type of file to import. 

3 Select the script file(s) you want to import. 

You can import files with the file extensions .txt, .Is, or ,js. The .Is extension is the Director 
linked script extension. 

To create a list of files you want to import, you can use the Add and Add All buttons. This is 
especially useful if you want to import scripts from multiple locations. 

4 Select Link to External File from the Media pop-up menu. 

5 Click Import. 


Writing scripts in the Script window 81 



You can edit linked scripts normally in the Director Script window. Changes you make are 
written to the external files each time you save your Director movie. (If you imported the linked 
script from a UNIX server, UNIX line endings are preserved.) If you import a script whose text 
file is locked, you won’t be able to edit the script in Director. 

You cannot apply custom text colors to linked scripts in the Script window. Script auto coloring, 
however, is enabled for linked scripts. 

To turn an internal script cast member into an external, linked script cast member: 

1 Select the internal cast member and click the Script tab of the Property inspector. 

2 Click Link Script As. 

3 Enter a name for the script file in the Save As dialog box. 

4 Click Save. 

To reload a linked script after it is edited: 

• Use the Member object’s uni oad() method. 

If a linked script is edited outside of Director, you can reload it by using the uni oad ( ) method in 
the Message window. The following statement causes the script member my Seri pt to be 
unloaded and then reloaded: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("mySeript").unioad() 

// JavaScript syntax 
member("mySeript").unioad();

CHAPTER 4 

Debugging Scripts in Director 


Scripts do not always do what you want the first time. The script often has an error in its syntax: 
possibly a word is misspelled or a small part of the script is missing. Other times, the script might 
work but does not produce the expected result. Mistakes or bugs almost always occur when 
writing your scripts, so you should allow enough time for debugging when you develop 
multimedia titles. 

As your skill with scripting increases, you’ll probably encounter different types of problems as you 
master one area but start learning others. However, the basic troubleshooting techniques 
described here are useful for novice and advanced users alike. 

The best way to correct a bug in your scripts varies from situation to situation. There are not 
one or two standard procedures that resolve the problem. You must use a variety of tools and 
techniques, such as the following: 

• An overview and understanding of how scripts in the movie interact with each other 

• Familiarity and practice with common debugging methods 
The following tools help you identify problems in scripts: 

• The Message window, when tracing is on, displays a record of the frames that play and the 
handlers that run in the movie. 

• The Debugger window displays the values of global variables, properties of the script that is 
currently running, the sequence of handlers that ran to get to the current point, and the value 
of variables and expressions that you select. 

• The Script window lets you enter comments, insert stopping points in the script, and select 
variables whose value is displayed in the Object inspector. 

• The Object inspector lets you view and set the values of objects and properties you select. 


83 



Good scripting habits 

Good scripting habits can help you avoid many scripting problems in the first place. 

• Try to write your scripts in small sets of statements and test each one as you write it. This 
isolates potential problems where they are easier to identify. 

• Insert comments that explain what the script statements are intended to do and what the 
values in the script are for. This makes it easier to understand the script if you return to it later 
or if someone else works on it. For example, the comment in the following statements make 
the purpose of the if. . .then structure and repeat loop clear: 

-- Lingo syntax 

-- Loop until the "s" key is pressed 
repeat while not(_key.keyPressecK "s")) 

_sound.beep() 
end repeat 

// JavaScript syntax 

// Loop until the "s" key is pressed 

whi 1 e(!_key.keyPressecK "s")) { 

_sound.beep(); 

1 

• Make sure that the script’s syntax is correct. Use the Script window’s pop-up menus to insert 
pre-formatted versions of scripting elements. Rely on the API topics of this reference to check 
that statements are set up correctly. 

• Use variable names that indicate the variables’ purpose. For example, a variable that contains a 
number should be called something like newNumber instead of ABC. 


Basic debugging 

Debugging involves strategy and analysis, not a standard step-by-step procedure. This section 
describes the basic debugging approaches that programmers successfully use to debug any code, 
not just Lingo or JavaScript syntax. 

Before you modify a movie significantly, always make a backup copy. It may help to name the 
copies incrementally, for example, fileName_01.dir, fileName_02.dir, fileName_03.dir, and so on 
to keep track of the various stages of a movie. 


Identifying the problem 

It might seem obvious, but the first thing to do when debugging is to identify the problem. Is a 
button doing the wrong thing? Is the movie going to the wrong frame? Is a field not editable 
when it should be? 

You may also want to determine what you expect a particular script to do, and then compare your 
expectation with what the script actually does. This process helps you clearly define your goal and 
see what parts of the goal are not being met. 

If you copied a script or a portion of a script from another movie or from a written example, 
check whether the script was designed for some specific conditions. Perhaps it requires that a 
sprite channel is already scripted. Maybe cast member names must follow a specific style 
convention. 


84 Chapter 4: Debugging Scripts in Director 



Locating the problem 

Do the following to start locating a problem: 

• Think backwards through the chain to identify where the unexpected started to happen. 

• Use the Message window to trace which frames the movie goes through and the handlers 
that your scripts run. 

• Determine what the scripts should be doing and consider what in these statements relates to 
the problem. For example, if a text cast member is not editable when you expect it to be, where 
in the movie does (or does not) your script set the cast member’s edi tabl e property? 

• If a sprite does not change as intended on the Stage, is the updateStage () method needed 
somewhere? 

• Does the problem occur only on certain computers and not others? Does it happen only when 
the display is set to millions of colors? Maybe something in the computer is interfering with 
the application. 

You can focus on specific lines of script by inserting a breakpoint—a point where the script pauses 
its execution and invokes the Debugger window—in a line. This gives you a chance to analyze 
conditions at that point before the script proceeds. For information on how to insert breakpoints 
in a script, see “Debugging in the Debugger window” on page 94. 

Solving simple problems 

When finding a bug, it’s a good idea to check for simple problems first. 

The first debugging test occurs when you compile your script. You can compile your script by 
doing one of the following: 

• In the Script window, click Recompile All Modified Scripts. 

• From the Control menu, click Recompile All Scripts. 

• Press Shift+F8. 

• Close the Script window. 

It is typically more convenient to compile scripts by using one of the first three options. The 
fourth option requires that you close the Script window each time you want to compile a script. 

When you compile your script, Macromedia Director MX 2004 gives you an error message if the 
script contains incorrect syntax. The message usually includes the line in which the problem was 
first detected. A question mark appears at the spot in the line where Director first found 
the problem. 



For example, the first line in the previous error message tells you that the script error in question 
is a syntax error, and also tells you what the syntax error is. The second line in the error message 
displays the actual line of code that contains the syntax error. 


Basic debugging 85 











Looking for syntax errors 

Syntax errors are probably the most common bug encountered while scripting. When a script 
fails, it is a good idea to first make sure that: 

• Terms are spelled correctly, spaces are in the correct places, and necessary punctuation is used. 
Director cannot interpret incorrect syntax. 

• Quotation marks surround the names of cast members, labels, and strings within a statement. 

• All necessary parameters are present. The specific parameters depend on the individual 
element. See the API topic entries in this reference to determine any additional parameters that 
an element requires. 

Looking for other simple bugs 

If your script compiles without an error message, it might contain a bug. If your script is not 
doing what you want, check the following: 

• Values for parameters are correct. For example, using an incorrect value for the number of 
beeps that you want the beep ( ) method to generate gives you the wrong number of beeps. 

• Values that change—such as variables and the content of text cast members—have the values 
you want. You can display their values in the Object inspector by selecting the name of the 
object and clicking Inspect Object in the Script window, or in the Message window by using 
the put ( ) or trace() functions. 

• The scripting elements do what you think they do. You can check their behavior by referring to 
the API topic entries in this reference. 

• If the script is written in JavaScript syntax, the script may contain a capitalization error. 
JavaScript syntax is case-sensitive, which means that all methods, functions, properties, and 
variables must be referred to by using the correct capitalization. 

If you attempt to call a method or function by using incorrect capitalization, you will receive a 
script error. 

If you attempt to access a variable or property by using incorrect capitalization, you may not 
receive a script error, but your script may not behave as expected. For example, the following 
mouseUp handler contains a statement that attempts to access the i temLabel property by using 
incorrect capitalization. This script does not produce a script error, but instead dynamically 
creates a new variable with the incorrect capitalization. The value of the newly created variable 
is undefined. 

// JavaScript syntax 
function beginSprite() { 

this . itemLabel = "Blue prints"; 

1 

function mouseUp!) { 

trace!this.itemlabel) // creates the itemlabel property

Debugging in the Script window 

The Script window contains several features that can help you debug scripts. 

To open the Script window: 

• Select Window > Script. 



To make the current line of code a comment: 

• Click Comment. 

To remove commenting from the current line of code: 

• Click Uncomment. 

To turn breakpoints in the current line of code on and off: 

• Click Toggle Breakpoint. 

To turn off all breakpoints. 

• Click Ignore Breakpoints. 

To add the selected expression or variable to the Object inspector: 

• Click Inspect Object. 

Debugging in the Message window 

The Message window provides a way for you to test scripting commands and to monitor what is 
happening in your scripts while a movie plays. 

To open the Message window: 

• Select Window > Message. 



Debugging in the Message window 87 



















Managing the Message window 

The Message window has an Input pane and an Output pane. The Input pane is editable. The 
Output pane is read-only. The only way to display text in the Output pane is by calling the put () 
or trace! ) functions. 

You can adjust the sizes of the Input and Output panes by dragging the horizontal divider that 
separates them. 

To resize the Output pane: 

• Drag the horizontal divider to a new position. 

To hide the Output pane completely: 

• Click the Collapse/Expand button in the center of the horizontal divider. 

When the Output pane is hidden, output from scripts that execute is displayed in the 
Input pane. 

To display the Output pane if it is hidden: 

• Click the Collapse/Expand button again. 

To clear the contents of the Message window: 

• Click the Clear button. 

If the Output pane is visible, its contents are deleted. 

If the Output pane is not visible, the contents of the Input pane are deleted. 

To delete a portion of the contents of the Output pane: 

1 Select the text to be deleted. 

2 Press the Backspace or Delete key. 

To copy text in the Input or Output pane: 

1 Select the text. 

2 Select Edit > Copy. 

Testing scripts in the Message window 

You can test Lingo and JavaScript syntax statements to see how they work by entering them in the 
Message window and observing the results. When you enter a command in the Message window, 
Director executes the command immediately, regardless of whether a movie is playing. 

Before entering the statements you want to test, you must first select which scripting syntax, 
Lingo or JavaScript syntax, you are going to test. 

To select the scripting syntax 

1 From the Script Syntax pop-up menu, select either Lingo or JavaScript. 

To test a one-line statement: 

1 Type the statement directly in the Message window. 

2 Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Macintosh). Director executes the statement. 

If the statement is valid, the Message window displays the result of the statement in the Output 
pane at the bottom of the window. If the script is invalid, an alert appears. 


88 Chapter 4: Debugging Scripts in Director 



For example, if you type the following statement into the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(50+50) 

// JavaScript syntax 
trace(50+50); 

and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Macintosh), the result appears in the Output pane: 

-- Lingo syntax 
-- 100 

// JavaScript syntax 
// 100 

If you type the following statement into the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.stage.bgColor = 255 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.stage.bgColor = 255; 

and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Macintosh), the Stage becomes black. 

You can test multiple lines of code all at once by copying and pasting statements into the Message 
window or by pressing Shift+Return after each line of code. 

To execute multiple lines of code by copying and pasting: 

1 Copy the lines of code to the clipboard. 

2 Enter a blank line in the Message window. 

3 Paste the code into the input pane of the Message window. 

4 Place the insertion point at the end of the last line of code. 

5 Press Control+Enter (Windows) or Control+Return (Macintosh). Director finds the first blank 
line above the insertion point and executes each line of code after the blank line in succession. 

To enter multiple lines of code manually: 

1 Enter a blank line in the Message window. 

2 Enter the first line of code. 

3 Press Shift+Return at the end of the line. 

4 Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have entered the last line of code. 

5 Press Control+Enter (Windows) or Control+Return (Macintosh). Director finds the first blank 
line above the insertion point and executes each line of code after the blank line in succession. 

You can test a handler without running the movie by writing the handler in a Movie Script or 
Behavior Script window, and then by calling it from the Message window. 

To test a handler: 

1 Copy and paste or manually enter a multiline handler into the Message window as described in 
the previous two procedures. 

2 Place the insertion point at the end of the last line of code. 

3 Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Macintosh). The handler executes. 

Any output from put () or trace!) statements in the handler appears in the Message window. 


Debugging in the Message window 89 



Like the Script window, the Message window contains pop-up menus of scripting commands. 
When you select a command from one of the pop-up menus, the command appears in the 
Message window with the first argument that you must provide selected. Several menus are 
provided to give you easy access to the whole catalog of scripting terms. 

The pop-up menus include the following: 

• Alphabetical Lingo includes all commands except 3D Lingo, presented in an alphabetical list. 

• Categorized Lingo includes all commands except 3D Lingo, presented in a categorized list. 

• Alphabetical 3D Lingo includes all 3D Lingo, presented in an alphabetical list. 

• Categorized 3D Lingo includes all 3D Lingo, presented in a categorized list. 

• Scripting Xtra extensions includes the methods and properties of all scripting Xtra extensions 
found, regardless of whether they are Macromedia or third-party Xtra extensions. 

Note: The scripting Xtra extensions listed in the Scripting Xtras pop-up menu are only those that 
support the i nterfacet) method and whose names actually appear in the pop-up menu. Although 
some cast member media types such as 3D and DVD also support the i nterfacet) method, they do 
not appear in the Scripting Xtras pop-up menu because they are not implemented in Director as 
scripting Xtra extensions. 

Monitoring scripts in the Message window 

You can set the Output pane of the Message window to display a record of the statements that a 
movie executes as it plays. This is useful for tracking the flow of your code and seeing the result of 
specific statements. You can do this in one of two ways. 

To display statements in the Output pane, do one of the following: 

• On the Message window, click Trace. 

• Set the Movie object’s traceScri pt property to TRUE. 



Entries after a double equal sign (==) indicate what has occurred in the movie—such as which 
frame the movie has just entered, which script is running, or the result of a method or setting 
a value. 

For example, the following line indicates several things: 

== Frame: 39 Script: 1 Handler: mouseUp 

• The movie entered frame 39. 

• The movie ran script 1, the first script attached to the frame. 

• The movie ran the mouseUp handler in script 1 after the movie entered the frame. 


90 Chapter 4: Debugging Scripts in Director 











Entries after an arrow made up of a double hyphen and right angle bracket (- - >) indicate lines of 
your code that have run. For example, the following Lingo lines: 

--> _sound.fadeOutl1, 5*60) 

--> if leftside < 10 then 
--> if leftside < 200 then 
--> _movie.got"Game Start") 

indicate that these Lingo statements have run. Suppose you were trying to determine why the 
playhead did not go to the frame labeled "Game Start." If the line - - > 

_movi e. go(" Game Start") never appeared in the Message window, maybe the condition in the 
previous statement was not what you expected. 

The Message window Output pane can fill with large amounts of text when the Trace button is 
on. To delete the contents of the Output pane, click the Clear button. If the Output pane is not 
visible, the contents of the Input pane are deleted. 

You can keep track of the value of variables and other objects by selecting the name of the object 
in the Message window and clicking the Inspect Object button. The object is added to the Object 
inspector, where its value is displayed and updated as the movie plays. For more information on 
the Object inspector, see “Debugging in the Object inspector” on page 91 . 

When you are in debugging mode, you can follow how a variable changes by selecting it in the 
Message window and then clicking the Watch Expression button. Director then adds the variable 
to the Watcher pane in the Debugger window, where its value is displayed and updated as you 
work in the Debugger window. For more information on the Watcher pane, see “Debugging in 
the Debugger window” on page 94. 

Debugging in the Object inspector 

With the Object inspector, you can view and set properties of many kinds of objects that are not 
displayed in the Property inspector. These include scripting objects such as global variables, lists, 
child objects from parent scripts, all 3D cast member properties, sprite properties, script 
expressions, and so on. In addition, the Object inspector displays changes to object properties 
that occur while a movie plays, such as changes due to scripts or changes to sprite Score 
properties. These kinds of runtime changes are not displayed in the Property inspector during 
movie playback. 

To open the Object inspector: 

• Select Window > Object Inspector.

Debugging in the Object inspector 91 






Understanding object structure 

The Object inspector can be very useful for understanding the structure of complex objects. For 
example, 3D cast members have many layers of properties. Because the Object inspector shows 
you a visual representation of the nested structure of those properties, it makes it much easier to 
become familiar with them and their relationships to each other. Understanding the property 
structure of objects in Director is important when writing scripts. 

The ability to watch the values of properties change while a movie plays is helpful for 
understanding what is happening in the movie. It is especially helpful when testing and 
debugging scripts because you can watch as the values change based on scripts you’ve written. 

The Director Debugger window displays this information also, but is only available when you 
are in debugging mode. For more information on debugging, see “Advanced debugging” 
on page 99. 

Viewable objects 

The following are some of the objects you can enter into the Object inspector: 

• Sprites, such as spri te(3) 

• Cast members, such as member! "3d") 

• Global variables, such as gMy Li st 

• Child objects, such as gMyChi 1 d 

• Macromedia Flash objects, such as gMy FI a s hOb j ect; for more information about using Flash 
objects in Director, see the Using Director topics in the Director Flelp Panel. 

• Script expressions, such as spri te (7 ) . blend 

Viewing objects 

There are three ways to view an object in the Object inspector. You can drag items directly into 
the Object inspector, enter the name of an item into the Object inspector manually, or use the 
Inspect Object button in the Message and Script windows. 

To drag an item to the Object inspector, do one of the following: 

• Select a sprite in the Score window and drag it to the Object inspector. 

• Select a cast member in the Cast window and drag it to the Object inspector. 

• Select a the name of an object in the Script, Message, or Text window and drag it to the 
Object inspector. 

To enter an object manually in the Object inspector: 

1 Double-click in the first empty cell in the Object column of the Object inspector. 

2 Type the name of the object into the cell. Use the same name you would use to refer to the 
object in your scripts. 

3 Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Macintosh). If the object has subproperties, a plus sign (+) 
appears to the left of it. 

4 Click the plus sign. The properties of the object appear below it. Properties with subproperties 
appear with a plus sign to their left. Click each plus sign to display the subproperties. 


92 Chapter 4: Debugging Scripts in Director 



To view an object using the Inspect Object button: 

1 In the Script window, highlight the part of a statement that refers to an object. 

2 In the Script window, click Inspect Object. If the object has subproperties, a plus sign (+) 
appears to the left of it. 

3 Click the plus sign. The properties of the object appear below it. Properties with subproperties 
appear with a plus sign to their left. Click each plus sign to display the subproperties. 

Note: Inspecting large numbers of objects or large individual objects in the Object inspector can 
cause noticeable performance issues during authoring, particularly when Auto Poll is enabled. For 
example, inspecting a list that contains 10,000 entries can make Director appear to hang while the 
display is updating. 

Navigating objects 

You can also navigate the contents of the Object inspector with the arrow keys on your keyboard. 

To move up or down in the list of items: 

• Use the Up and Down arrow keys. 

To view an item’s subproperties: 

• Select the item and press the Right arrow key. 

To hide an item’s subproperties: 

• Select the item and press the Left arrow key. 

Using Autopoll 

System properties, such as mi 11 i seconds and col orDepth are only updated in the Object 
inspector when the Autopoll option is turned on. Using Autopoll increases the processor 
worldoad, which can slow your movie’s performance when you add more than a few system 
properties to the Object inspector. 

To turn on Autopoll: 

1 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Macintosh) in the Object inspector. The Object 
inspector context menu appears. 

2 Select Autopoll from the context menu. When Autopoll is on, a check mark appears next to the 
Autopoll item in the context menu. 

To turn off Autopoll: 

• Select Autopoll from the context menu again. 

Modifying object or property values 

You can set the value of an object or property in the Object inspector by entering a new value in 
the box to the right of the object or property name. 

To set an object or property value: 

1 Double-click the value to the right of the item name. 

2 Enter the new value for the item. 

3 Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Macintosh). The new value is set and reflected in your 
movie immediately. 

You can enter a script expression as the value for an item. For example, you might set the value of 
spri te (3). 1 ocH to the expression spri te (8). 1 ocH + 20. 


Debugging in the Object inspector 93 



Removing objects 

You can also remove items from the Object inspector. 

To remove a single item from the Object inspector: 

• Select the item and press the Backspace (Windows) or Delete (Macintosh) key. 

To clear the entire contents of the Object inspector: 

• Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Macintosh) inside the Object inspector and select 
Clear All from the context menu. 

When you open a separate movie from the one you are working on, the objects you entered in the 
Object inspector remain. This makes it easy to compare different versions of the same movie. 
When you exit Director, the items in the Object inspector are lost. 

Debugging in the Debugger window 

The Debugger window is a special mode of the Script window. It provides several tools for finding 
the causes of problems in your scripts. By using the Debugger, you can quickly locate the parts of 
your code that are causing problems. The Debugger window allows you to run scripts one line at 
a time, skip over nested handlers, edit the text of scripts, and view the values of variables and other 
objects as they change. Learning to use the tools in the Debugger window can help you become a 
more efficient programmer. 

The Debugger window can help you locate and correct errors in your scripts. It includes several 
tools that let you do the following: 

• See the part of the script that includes the current line of code. 

• Track the sequence of handlers that were called before getting to the current handler. 

• Run selected parts of the current handler. 

• Run selected parts of nested handlers called from the current handler. 

• Display the value of any local variable, global variable, or property related to the code that 
you’re investigating. 

Entering debugging mode 

In order to access the Debugger window, a break must occur in a script. A break occurs when 
Director encounters a script error or a breakpoint in a script. 

When a script error occurs, the Script Error dialog box appears. The dialog box displays 
information about the type of error that occurred, and asks you whether you want to debug the 
script, edit the script in the Script window, or cancel. 

To enter debugging mode, do one of the following: 

• Click Debug in the Script Error dialog box. 

• Place a breakpoint in a script. 

When Director runs and encounters a breakpoint, the script stops executing and the Script 
window changes to debugging mode. The movie is still playing, but the execution of your scripts 
is stopped until you use the Debugger to tell Director how to proceed. If you have multiple Script 
windows open, Director searches for one containing the script where the breakpoint occurred and 
changes that window to debugging mode. 


94 Chapter 4: Debugging Scripts in Director 



To add a breakpoint that will open the Debugger window: 

1 In the Script window, open the script that should contain the breakpoint. 

2 Click in the left margin of the Script window next to the line of code where you want the 
breakpoint to appear, or place the insertion point on the line of code and click Toggle 
Breakpoint. Your code will stop executing at the beginning of this line, and the Script window 
will enter debugging mode. 

If the Script window is open when Director encounters a script error or a breakpoint, the 
Debugger window replaces the Script window. 



To stop debugging, do one of the following: 

• Click the Run Script button in the Debugger window. This resumes normal script execution. 

• Click the Stop Debugging button in the Debugger window. This stops both the debugging 
session and the movie. 

The Script window reappears in place of the Debugger window. 

When the Debugger window opens, it shows the current line of code and offers several choices for 
what to run next. 

To see which is the current line of code: 

• Look for the green arrow next to a line of code in the Script pane. 

The green arrow points to the current line. You cannot select a different line of code by 
clicking it in the Script pane. 

Viewing the call stack in the Debugger window 

The Call Stack pane displays the sequence of nested handlers that ran before the current line of 
code. This sequence is called the call stack. Use the call stack to keep track of the structure of your 
code while you are debugging. You can view the variables associated with a specific handler by 
clicking the handler name in the Call Stack pane. The variables are displayed in the Variable pane. 


Debugging in the Debugger window 95 
























Viewing variables in the Debugger window 

The Variable pane of the Debugger window displays the variables associated with the current 
handler. The current handler is the handler displayed in the Script pane and the last handler 
displayed in the Call Stack pane. You can also display the variables associated with previous 
handlers in the call stack. As you step through a script, changes to the values of any of the 
variables are displayed in red. For more information on stepping through scripts, see “Stepping 
through scripts in the Debugger window” on page 97. 

To display the variables associated with a handler in the call stack: 

• Click the name of the handler in the Call Stack pane. The variables appear in the 
Variable pane. 

The Variable pane includes four tabs for viewing variables: 

The All tab displays both global and local variables associated with the current handler. 

The Local tab displays only the local variables associated with the selected handler. 

The Property tab displays the properties declared by the current script. 

The Global tab displays only the global variables associated with the selected handler. 

You can sort the variables in the Variable pane: 

• To sort the variables by name, click the word Name that appears above the variable names. 

• To sort the variables in reverse-alphabetical order, click the word Name a second time. 

You can change the values of local variables of the current handler and global variables in the 
Variable pane. You cannot change the value of local variables that are not in the current handler. 

To change the value of a variable in the Variable pane: 

1 Double-click the value of the variable in the Value column. 

2 Enter the new value for the variable. 

3 Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Macintosh). 

Viewing objects in the Debugger window 

With the Watcher pane in the Debugger window, you can view variables and other data objects 
associated with the current handler, as well as objects associated with other handlers. By adding 
objects to the Watcher pane, you can keep track of their values as they change because of scripts. 
When the value of an object changes due to the execution of a line of code, Director changes the 
color of the objects name in the Watcher pane to red. 

The Watcher pane displays only the objects you add to it. You can use up to four separate tabs in 
the Watcher pane to organize objects into groups. 

To add an object to the Watcher pane whose name appears in the Script pane: 

1 Select the name of the object in the Script pane. 

2 Click the Watch Expression button. 


96 Chapter 4: Debugging Scripts in Director 



To add an object to the Watcher pane whose name does not appear in the Script pane: 

1 Double-click the first empty cell in the object column of the Watcher pane. 

2 Type the name of the object in the cell and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Macintosh). 

If the object has properties, a plus sign (+) appears next to the object’s name. 

To display an object’s properties: 

• Click the plus sign next to the object name. 

The Watcher pane lets you organize objects in a few ways. 

To organize objects in the Watcher pane, do one of the following: 

• To sort the objects in the Watcher pane, click the Name column head at the top of the left 
column. The object names in the column are listed in alphabetical order. 

• To sort the objects in reverse-alphabetical order, click the Name column head a second time. 

• To organize objects into groups, use the tabs in the Watcher pane. To add an object to a 
specific tab, click the tab you want to use before adding the object. 

• To clear the contents of a tab in the Watcher pane, select the tab and then right-click 
(Windows) or Control-click (Macintosh) in the Watcher pane and select Clear All. 

Stepping through scripts in the Debugger window 

The Debugger window provides you with a set of tools for running scripts slowly, so you can 
watch the effect that each line of code has on your movie. You can execute one line of code at a 
time and choose whether to execute nested handlers one line at a time or all at once. 

To execute only the current line of code indicated by the green arrow: 

• Click the Step Script button. 

Many handlers include calling statements to other handlers. You can focus your attention on such 
nested handlers, or ignore them and focus on the code in the current handler. 

When you are confident that nested handlers are performing as expected and want to concentrate 
on the code in the current handler, the Debugger window can step over nested handlers and go 
directly to the next line of code in the current handler. When the Debugger steps over a 
nested handler, it executes the handler, but does not display the handler’s code or pause within 
the nested handler. 

To step over nested handlers: 

• Click the Step Script button in the Debugger window. 

The Step Script button runs the current line of code, runs any nested handlers that the line 
calls, and then stops at the next line in the handler. 

If you suspect that nested handlers are not performing as expected and want to study their 
behavior, the Debugger window can run nested handlers line by line as well. 

To run nested handlers one line at a time: 

• Click the Step Into Script button in the Debugger window. 

Clicking the Step Into button runs the current line of code and follows the normal flow 
through any nested handlers called by that line. When finished with a nested handler, the 
Debugger window stops at the next line of code within the upper-level handler. 


Debugging in the Debugger window 97 



When you are finished debugging, you can exit the Debugger at any time: 

To resume normal execution of code an exit the Debugger window: 

• Click the Run Script button. 

To exit the Debugger and stop playback of the movie: 

• Click the Stop Debugging button. 

Editing scripts in debugging mode 

When you are in debugging mode, you may edit your scripts directly in the Debugger window. 
This enables you to fix bugs as soon as you find them and then continue debugging. 

To edit a script in the Debugger window: 

1 Click in the Script pane and place the insertion point where you want to begin typing. 

2 Enter the changes to the script. 

You can jump to a specific handler by selecting the name of the handler and clicking the Go To 
Handler button. 

3 When you are finished debugging and editing scripts, click the Stop Debugging button. The 
Script window returns to Script mode. 

4 Click the Recompile All Modified Scripts button. 

Debugging projectors and Shockwave movies 

This section discusses debugging during runtime in Director projectors and movies that contain 
Macromedia Shockwave content. You can use either the Message window or enable full script 
error dialog boxes to debug projectors and movies that contain Shockwave content. 

To debug using the Message window: 

• Set the Player object’s debugPl aybackEnabl ed property to TRUE. 

When this property is TRUE, playing back a projector or a movie that contains Shockwave 
content opens a Message window (Windows) or a Message text file (Macintosh), and the 
results of any put( ) or trace! ) function calls are output to these formats. 

If at any time during the movie the debugPl aybackEnabl ed property is set to FALSE, the 
Message window or text file is closed and cannot be opened again during that playback session, 
even if debugPl aybackEnabl ed is set back to TRUE later in that session. 

To debug by enabling full script error dialogs: 

• In an .ini file for a projector or a movie that contains Shockwave content, set the 
Di spl ayFul 1 Li ngoErrorText property to 1. 

This generates more descriptive error text in the script error dialog box than the generic error 
text. For example, a generic error message might look like: 

Script error: Continue? 

Setting the Di spl ayFul 1 Li ngoErrorText property to 1 could generate the following 
error message: 

Script error: list expected 

For information on creating and modifying an appropriate .ini file for a projector or a movie 
that contains Shockwave content, see the Director.ini template file in the root Director 
installation folder. 


98 Chapter 4: Debugging Scripts in Director 



Advanced debugging 

If the problem is not easy to identify, try the following approaches: 

• Determine which section has the problem. For example, if clicking a button produces the 
wrong result, investigate the script assigned to the button. 

If a sprite does the wrong thing, try checking the sprite’s property values. Are they set to the 
values you want when you want? 

• Figure out where the script flows. When a section of the movie does not do what you want, 
first try to trace the movie’s sequence of events in your head. Look at other scripts in the 
message hierarchy to make sure Director is running the correct handler. 

• Follow the tracing in the Message window; this shows which frames the movie goes through 
and any handlers that the movie calls as the movie plays. 

• Try using the Step Script and Step Into features in the Debugger window and see whether the 
results differ from what you expect. 

• Check variables and expressions. Analyze how their values change as the movie plays. See if 
they change at the wrong time or do not change at all. If the same variable is used in more than 
one handler, make sure that each handler that uses the variable states that the variable is global. 
You can track the values of variables and expressions by displaying their values in the Watcher 
pane of the Debugger window or the Object inspector. 

• Make changes one at a time. Don’t be afraid to change things in a handler to see if the change 
eliminates the problem or gives some result that helps point to the problem. 

However, do not trade one problem for another. Change things one at a time and change them 
back if the problem is not fixed. If you introduce too many changes before solving a problem, 
you might not determine what the original problem was and you might even introduce 
new problems. 

• Re-create the section. If you have not found the problem, try re-creating the section from 
scratch. For example, if rolling the pointer over a sprite does not make the sprite behave the 
way you want, create a simple movie that contains just the sprite and handler with the 

rol 1 Overt ) method. 

Do not just copy and paste scripts; that might just copy the problem. Re-creating the section 
lets you reconstruct the logic at its most basic level and verify that Director is working as you 
expect. If the section that you re-create still does not work properly, chances are that there is 
something wrong in the logic for the section. 

If the section that you re-create works properly, compare that section to the original movie to 
see where the two differ. You can also copy the section into the original piece and see whether 
this corrects the problem.

CHAPTER 5 

Director Core Objects 


The core objects in Macromedia Director MX 2004 provide access to the core functionality and 
features available in Director, projectors, and the Macromedia Shockwave Player. Core objects 
include the Director player engine, movie windows, sprites, sounds, and so on. They represent the 
base layer through which almost all APIs and other object categories are accessed; the exceptions 
are the scripting objects, which extend the core functionality of Director. 

For an illustration of how the core objects relate to each other and to other objects in Director, see 
“Object model diagrams” on page 53. 


Cast Library 

Represents a single cast library within a movie. 

A movie can consist of one or more cast libraries. A cast library can consist of one or more cast 
members, which represent media in a movie, such as sounds, text, graphics, and other movies. 

You can create a reference to a cast library by using either the top level c a s t L i b () function or the 
Movie object’s castLi b property. For example, if a movie contains a cast library named scri pts, 
you could create a reference to this cast library by doing the following: 

• Use the top level castLi b( ) method. 

-- Lingo syntax 

libScript = cast Lib("scripts") 

// JavaScript syntax 

var libScript = castLib("scripts"); 

• Use the Movie object’s castLi b property. 

-- Lingo syntax 

libScript = _movie.cast Lib["scri pts" ] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var libScript = _movie.cast Lib["scri pts"];

Global 

Provides a location to store and access global variables. These variables are available to both Lingo 
and JavaScript syntax. 

You can access the Global object by using the top level _gl obal property. You can either assign 

_g 1 oba 1 to a variable, or use the _g 1 oba 1 property directly to access the Global object’s methods 

and any defined global variables. 

• Assign _g 1 o b a 1 to a variable. 

-- Lingo syntax 
obj G1obal = _global 

// JavaScript syntax 
var objGlobal = _g 1 oba 1 ; 

• Use the _gl obal property directly. 

-- Lingo syntax 
_global.showGlobals() 

// JavaScript syntax 
_global.showGlobals(); 

• Access a global variable. 

-- Lingo syntax

end 

// JavaScript syntax 

_globa1.gSuccess = "Congratulations!"; 

function mouseDown!) {

Member 


Represents a cast member within a cast library. Cast members are the media and script assets in a 
movie. Media cast members may be text, bitmaps, shapes, and so on. Script cast members include 
behaviors, movie scripts, and so on. 

A cast member can be referenced either by number or by name. 

• When referring to a cast member by number, Director searches a particular cast library for that 
cast member, and retrieves the member’s data. This method is faster than referring to a cast 
member by name. However, because Director does not automatically update references to cast 
member numbers in script, a numbered reference to a cast member that has moved position in 
its cast library will be broken. 

• When referring to a cast member by name, Director searches all cast libraries in a movie from 
first to last, and retrieves the member’s data when it finds the named member. This method is 
slower than referring to a cast member by number, especially when referring to large movies 
that contain many cast libraries and cast members. However, a named reference to a cast 
member allows the reference to remain intact even if the cast member moves position in its 
cast library. 

You can create a reference to a cast member by using either the top level member ( ) function, or by 
using the member property of the Cast, Movie, or Sprite object. 

The following examples illustrate creating a reference to a cast member. 

• Use the top level member! ) function. 

-- Lingo syntax 

objTree = member!"bmpTree") 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objTree = member!"bmpTree"); 

• Use the Sprite object’s member property. 

-- Lingo syntax 

objTree = sprite(l).member; 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objTree = sprite(l).member;

Provides access to a user’s mouse activity, including mouse movement and mouse clicks. 

You can access the Mouse object by using the top level _mouse property. You can either assign 
_mouse to a variable, or use the _mouse property directly to access the Mouse object’s properties. 

• Assign _mouse to a variable. 

-- Lingo syntax 
objMouse = _mouse 

// JavaScript syntax

Movie 

Represents a movie being played within the Director player. 

The Director player can contain one or more movies. A movie can consist of one or more cast 
libraries. A cast library can consist of one or more cast members, which represent the media and 
script assets in a movie. Media cast members may be text, bitmaps, shapes, and so on. Script cast 
members include behaviors, movie scripts, and so on. Sprites are created from cast members and 
are used on the Stage of a movie. 

You can refer to the currently active movie by using the top level _movi e property. You can refer 
to any movie in the player by using the Window object’s movie property. 

• Refer to the currently active movie. 

-- Lingo syntax 
objMovie = _movie 

// JavaScript syntax 
var objMovie = _movie; 

• Use the Window object’s movie property to access the movie in a particular window. 

-- Lingo syntax 

objMovie = _player.window[2].movie 
// JavaScript syntax 

var objMovie = _player.window[2].movie; 

In Director MX 2004, you can use a movie reference to access not only the methods and 
properties of a movie itself, you can also call Lingo and JavaScript syntax handlers, and access the 
movie’s cast members and sprites, including their methods and properties. This differs from 
previous versions of Director in which you had to use the tel 1 command to work with movies. 
The Movie object provides a simpler way to work with movies. 

Note: The tel 1 command is obsolete in Director MX 2004,

Represents the core playback engine used to manage and execute the authoring environment, 
movies in a window (MIAWs), projectors, and Shockwave Player. 

The Player object provides access to all of the movies and windows that it is managing, in 
addition to any Xtra extensions that are available. 

You can create a reference to the Player object by using the top level _pl ayer property. 

• Assign _pl ayer to a variable.

Sound Channel 


Represents an individual sound channel found within the Sound object. 

There are eight available sound channels. You can use a Sound Channel object in script to access 
and modify any of the eight sound channels. 

Note: You can modify only the first two sound channels in the Score of the Director user interface. 

You can create a reference to a Sound Channel object by using the top level sound () method, the 
Player object’s sound property, or the Sound object’s channel () method. For example, you can 
reference sound channel 2 by doing the following: 

• Use the top level sound () method. 

-- Lingo syntax 
objSoundChannel = sound(2) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objSoundChannel = sound(2); 

• Use the Player object’s sound property. 

-- Lingo syntax 

objSoundChannel = _player.sound[2] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objSoundChannel = _player.sound[2]; 

• Use the Sound object’s c h a n n e 1 () method. 

-- Lingo syntax 

objSoundChannel = _sound.channel (2) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objSoundChannel = _sound.channel (2);

Sprite 

Represents an occurrence of a cast member in a sprite channel of the Score. 

A Sprite object covers a sprite span, which is a range of frames in a given sprite channel. A Sprite 
Channel object represents an entire sprite channel, regardless of the number of sprites it contains. 

A sprite can be referenced either by number or by name. 

• When referring to a sprite by number, Director searches all sprites that exist in the current 
frame of the Score, starting from the lowest numbered channel, and retrieves the sprite’s data 
when it finds the numbered sprite. This method is faster than referring to a sprite by name. 
However, because Director does not automatically update references to sprite numbers in 
script, a numbered reference to a sprite that has moved position on the Stage will be broken. 

• When referring to a sprite by name, Director searches all sprites that exist in the current frame 
of the Score, starting from the lowest numbered channel, and retrieves the sprite’s data when it 
finds the named sprite. This method is slower than referring to a sprite by number, especially 
when referring to large movies that contain many cast libraries, cast members, and sprites. 
However, a named reference to a sprite allows the reference to remain intact even if the sprite 
moves position on the Stage. 

You can create a reference to a Sprite object by using the top level spri te( ) function, the Movie 
object’s sprite property, or the Sprite Channel object’s sprite property. 

• Use the top level spri te( ) function. 

-- Lingo syntax 
objSprite = spri ted) 

// JavaScript syntax 
var objSprite = sprite(l); 

• Use the Movie object’s sprite property. 

-- Lingo syntax 

objSprite = _movi e. spri te[ "wi 11 owTree"]: 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objSprite = _movie.sprite["willowTree"]; 

• Use the Sprite Channel object’s sprite property. 

-- Lingo syntax 

objSprite = channel(3).sprite 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objSprite = channel(3).sprite; 


112 Chapter 5: Director Core Objects 








You can use a reference to a Sprite object to access the cast member from which the sprite was 
created. Any changes made to the cast member from which a sprite was created are also reflected 
in the sprite. The following example illustrates changing the text of a text cast member from 
which sprite 5 was created. This change to the cast member will also be reflected in sprite 5. 

-- Lingo syntax 
labelText = sprite(5) 

1abelText.member.text = "Weeping Willow" 

// JavaScript syntax 
var labelText = sprite(5); 

1abelText.member.text = "Weeping Willow";

Sprite channels are controlled by the Score by default. Use the Sprite Channel object to switch 
control of a sprite channel over to script during a Score recording session. 

A sprite channel can be referenced either by number or by name. 

• When referring to a sprite channel by number, you access the channel directly. This method is 
faster than referring to a sprite channel by name. However, because Director does not 
automatically update references to sprite channel numbers in script, a numbered reference to a 
sprite channel that has moved position in the Score will be broken. 

• When referring to a sprite channel by name, Director searches all channels, starting from the 
lowest numbered channel, and retrieves the sprite channel’s data when it finds the named sprite 
channel. This method is slower than referring to a sprite channel by number, especially when 
referring to large movies that contain many cast libraries, cast members, and sprites. However, 
a named reference to a sprite channel allows the reference to remain intact even if the sprite 
channel moves position in the Score. 

You can create a reference to a Sprite Channel object by using the top level channel ( ) method, 
and referring to either the channel number or name. 

-- Lingo syntax 

objSpriteChannel = channel(2) -- numbered reference 
objSpriteChannel = channel("background") -- named reference 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objSpriteChannel = channel(2); // numbered reference 

var objSpriteChannel = channel("background"); // named reference 

You can use a reference to a Sprite Channel object to access the sprite that is currently being used 
in a particular sprite channel. The following example illustrates accessing the background color of 
the sprite that is currently being used in sprite channel 2. 

-- Lingo syntax 

labelSprite = channel(2).sprite.backColor 
// JavaScript syntax 

var labelSprite = channel(2).sprite.backColor;

Window 


Represents a window in which a movie is playing, including the Stage window and any other 
movies in a window (MIAWs) that are in use. 

You can create a reference to a Window object by using the top level wi ndow( ) function, the 
Player object’s wi ndow property, or the Player object’s wi ndowLi st property. 

• Use the top level window!) method. 

-- Lingo syntax 
objWindow = window("Sun") 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objWindow = window("Sun"); 

• Use the Player object’s wi ndow property. 

-- Lingo syntax 

objWindow = _player.window["Sun"] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objWindow = _player.window["Sun"]; 

• Use the Player object’s wi ndowLi st property. 

-- Lingo syntax 

objWindow = _p!ayer.windowList[l] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objWindow = _player.windowList[l]; 

Note: When creating a named reference to a window by using either the top level wi ndow() function 
or the Player object's wi ndow property, a reference to that window is created only if a window by that 
name exists. If a window by that name does not exist, the reference contains VOID (Lingo) or nul 1 
(JavaScript syntax).

CHAPTER 6 

Media Types 


The media types in Macromedia Director MX 2004 provide access to the functionality of the 
various media types, such as RealMedia, DVD, Animated GIF, and so on, that are added to 
movies as cast members. 

Literally, media types are not actually objects, but rather cast members that are of a specific type of 
media. When a media type is added to a movie as a cast member, it not only inherits the 
functionality of the core Member object, it also extends the Member object by providing 
additional functionality that is available only to the specified media type. For example, a 
RealMedia cast member has access to the Member objects methods and properties, but it also has 
additional methods and properties that are specific to RealMedia. All other media types also 
exhibit this behavior. 

For an illustration of how the cast member media types relate to each other and to other objects in 
Director, see “Object model diagrams” on page 53. 

Animated GIF 

Represents an animated GIF cast member. 

You can add an animated GIF cast member to a movie by using the Movie object’s newMember () 
method. 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.newMember(#animgi f) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.newMember!"animgif"); 

Some of the following methods or properties may apply only to sprites that are created from an 
animated GIF cast member.

Bitmap 

Represents a bitmap cast member. 

You can use bitmap image objects to perform simple operations that affect the content of an 
entire bitmap cast member, such as changing the background and foreground colors of the 
member, or to perform fine manipulations of the pixels of an image, such as cropping, drawing, 
and copying pixels. 

You can add a bitmap cast member to a movie by using the Movie object’s newMember( ) method. 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.newMember(#bi tmap) 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.newMember("bitmap"); 

Some of the following methods or properties may apply only to sprites that are created from a

Color Palette 

Represents the color palette associated with a bitmap cast member. 

A color palette cast member does not have any methods or properties that can be accessed directly 
from it. The following methods and properties are merely associated with color palettes. 

You can add a color palette cast member to a movie by using the Movie object’s newMember!) 
method. 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.newMember(#pal ette) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.newMember!"palette"); 


Color Palette 121 









You can associate a bitmap cast member with a color palette cast member by setting the pal ette 
property of the bitmap cast member. The following example sets the pal ette property of the 
bitmap cast member bmpMember to the color palette cast member col orPal etteMember. The 
value of the palette property reflects the number of the color palette cast member. 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"bmpMember").palette = member!"colorPaletteMember") 

// JavaScript syntax 

member!"bmpMember").palette = member!"colorPaletteMember"); 

After you associate a bitmap cast member with a color palette cast member, you cannot delete the 
color palette cast member until you remove its association with the bitmap cast member.

Scripting Objects 


The scripting objects, also known as Xtra extensions, in Macromedia Director MX 2004 provide 
access to the functionality of the software components that are installed with Director and extend 
core Director functionary. The preexisting Xtra extensions provide capabilities such as importing 
filters and connecting to the Internet. If you know the C programming language, you can create 
your own custom Xtra extensions. 

For an illustration of how the scripting objects relate to each other and to other objects in 
Director, see “Object model diagrams” on page 53. 

Fileio 

Enables you to perform file input and output operations. 

You can create a reference to a Fileio object by using the new operator.

CHAPTER 8 

3D Objects 


The 3D objects enable you to add 3D functionality to a movie. These objects are exposed to both 
Lingo and JavaScript syntax within Macromedia Director MX 2004, projectors, and the 
Macromedia Shockwave Player. 

You access these 3D objects through Shockwave 3D (or simply 3D) cast members. You can also 
create 3D sprites from the 3D cast members. Both 3D cast members and 3D sprites contain 
functionality that is specific to 3D cast members and sprites. They also have access to the 
functionality of non-3D cast members and sprites, whose APIs are specified by the core Member 
and Sprite objects, respectively. 

A 3D cast member differs from a non-3D cast member in that a 3D cast member contains a 
complete 3D world. A 3D world contains the objects that provide access to 3D functionality. All 
objects in a 3D world are based on a basic object known as a node. The simplest form of a node in 
a 3D world is a Group object; a Group object is essentially the most basic node. All other objects 
in a 3D world are based on a Group object, which means that the other objects inherit the 
functionality of a Group object in addition to containing functionality that is specific to 
those objects. 

For an illustration of how the 3D objects relate to each other and to other objects in Director, see 
“Object model diagrams” on page 53. 

Director ships with two Xtra extensions that enable access to the 3D objects: 

• 3D Asset Xtra (3DAuth.x32 in Windows, 3D Auth Xtra on Macintosh) provides support for 
the 3D media window inside Director. 

• 3D Media Xtra (Shockwave 3D Asset.x32 in Windows, 3D Asset Xtra on Macintosh) provides 
support for the 3D media itself. 

To access the 3D objects during authoring or at runtime, your movie must contain the 3D 
Asset Xtra. 


141 



Camera 


Represents a Camera object. 

A camera controls how a 3D sprite views the 3D world. A 3D sprite displays a particular camera’s 
view into the world. 

You can create a reference to a camera by using the camera property of the 3D Member object. 
The camera property gets the camera at a specified index position in the list of cameras. In Lingo, 
you use the camera property directly from the 3D Member object to create a reference. In 
JavaScript syntax, you must use the getPropRef ( ) method to create a reference. 

The following example creates a reference to the second camera of the 3D cast member "family 
room", and assigns it to the variable myCamera. 

-- Lingo syntax 

myCamera = member!"family room").camera[2] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myCamera = member!"family room").getPropRef ( "camera", 2);

Group 

Represents a model that does not have a resource or any shaders. 

A group is the most basic node, and is merely a point in space that is represented by a transform. 
You can assign children and parents to this node in order to group models, lights, cameras, or 
other groups. 

The most basic group is called a world, which is essentially synonymous with a 3D cast member. 

You can create a reference to a group by using the group property of the 3D Member object. The 
group property gets the group at a specified index position in the list of groups. In Lingo, you use 
the group property directly from the 3D Member object to create a reference. In JavaScript syntax, 
you must use the getPropRefO method to create a reference. 

The following example creates a reference to the first group of the 3D cast member space, and 
assigns it to the variable my Group. 

-- Lingo syntax 

myGroup = member("space").group[l] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myGroup = member("space").getPropRef("group", 1);

Light 

Represents a light in a 3D world. 

Lights are used to light a 3D world. Without lights, the objects within the world cannot be seen. 

You can create a reference to a light by using the 1 i ght property of the 3D Member object. The 
light property gets the light at a specified index position in the list of lights. In Lingo, you use 
the light property directly from the 3D Member object to create a reference. In JavaScript syntax, 
you must use the getPropRefC) method to create a reference. 

The following example creates a reference to the third light of the 3D cast member "film room" 
and assigns it to the variable my Li ght. 

-- Lingo syntax 

myLight = memberC'film room"). 1 ight[3] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myLight = memberC'film room"). getPropRef( "1 i ght", 3);

Member 


Represents a Shockwave 3D cast member. 

A Shockwave 3D (or simply 3D) cast member contains a complete 3D world. A 3D world 
contains the set of objects you use to add 3D functionality to a movie. 

You can create a reference to a 3D cast member by using either the top level member () function, 
or by using the member property of the Movie or Sprite object. These are the same techniques you 
can use to create a reference to a non-3D cast member. 

• Use the top level member! ) function. 

-- Lingo syntax 
3dMember = member!"magic") 

// JavaScript syntax 

var 3dMember = member!"magic"); 

• Use the Sprite object’s member property. 

-- Lingo syntax 

3dMember = sprite(l).member; 

// JavaScript syntax 

var 3dMember = sprite(l).member;

Model 

Represents a visible object that a user sees within a 3D world. 

A model makes use of a model resource and occupies a specific position and orientation with a 
3D world. A model resource is an element of 3D geometry that can be used to draw 3D models. 
A model also defines the appearance of the model resource, such as what textures and shaders are 
used. For more information about the relationship between models and model resources, see the 
Using Director topics in the Director Help Panel. 

You can create a reference to a model by using the model property of the 3D Member object. The 
model property gets the model at a specified index position in the list of models. In Lingo, you 
use the model property directly from the 3D Membe r object to create a reference. In JavaScript 
syntax, you must use the getPropRef( ) method to create a reference. 

The following example creates a reference to the second model of the 3D cast member 
Transportati on and assigns it to the variable myModel. 

-- Lingo syntax 

myModel = member!"Transportation").model[2] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myModel = member!"Transportation").getPropRef!"model", 2); 


146 Chapter 8: 3D Objects 






A model also contains modifiers that control how the model is rendered or how its animation 
behaves. Modifiers are attached to a model by using the addModi f i er () method. After a modifier 
has been attached to a model, its properties can be manipulated with script. 

The following modifiers are available to a model: 

Modifier Description 

Bones player Modifies a model's geometry over time. 

Collision Allows a model to be notified of and respond to collisions. 

Inker Adds silhouette, crease, and boundary edges to an existing model. 

Keyframe player Modifies a model's transform properties overtime. 

Level of detail (LOD) Provides per-model control over the number of polygons used to 

render a model, based on the model’s distance from a camera. 

The LOD modifier is also available to model resources. 

Mesh deform Alters an existing model resource's geometry at runtime. 

Subdivision surfaces (SDS) Causes the model to be rendered with additional geometric detail in the 
area of the model that the camera is currently looking at. 

Toon Changes a model’s rendering to imitate a cartoon drawing style. 

For more information about the methods, properties, and events available to the modifiers, see 
the Using Director topics in the Director Help Panel. 

Model Resource 

Represents an element of 3D geometry that is used to draw 3D models. 

A model makes use of a model resource and occupies a specific position and orientation with a 
3D world. A model also defines the appearance of the model resource, such as what textures and 
shaders are used. 

For more information about the relationship between models and model resources, and about 
using models and model resources, see the Using Director topics in the Director Help Panel. 

You can create a reference to a model resource by using the model Resource property of the 3D 
Member object. The model Resource property gets the model resource at a specified index 
position in the list of model resources. In Lingo, you use the model Resource property directly 
from the 3D Member object to create a reference. In JavaScript syntax, you must use the 
getPropRefO method to create a reference. 

The following example creates a reference to the second model resource of the 3D cast member 
wheel s and assigns it to the variable myModel Resource. 

-- Lingo syntax 

myModelResource = membert"wheels").modelResource[2] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myModelResource = memberf"wheels").getPropReff"model Resource”, 2); 


Model Resource 147 



Motion 


Represents a predefined animation sequence that involve the movement of a model or a 
model component. 

Individual motions can be set to play by themselves or with other motions. For example, a 
running motion can be combined with a jumping motion to simulate a person jumping over 
a puddle. 

You can create a reference to a motion by using the moti on property of the 3D Member object. 
The moti on property gets the motion at a specified index position in the list of motions. In 
Lingo, you use the moti on property directly from the 3D Member object to create a reference. In 
JavaScript syntax, you must use the getPropRef ( ) method to create a reference. 

The following example creates a reference to the fourth motion of the 3D cast member athl ete 
and assigns it to the variable my Moti on. 

-- Lingo syntax 

myMotion = memberi"athlete").motion[4] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myMotion = memberi"athlete").getPropRef("motion", 4); 

Renderer Services 

Represents the global object that contains a property list whose values impact common rendering 
properties for all 3D cast members and sprites. 

You can access the global renderer services object using the top level getRendererServi ces () 
function. 

The following example accesses the renderer property of the global renderer services object and 
assigns the value to the variable my Renderer. 

-- Lingo syntax 

myRenderer = getRendererServices().renderer 
// JavaScript syntax 

var myRenderer = getRendererServices().renderer;

Member, Sprite 

Shader 

Represents a model’s surface color. 

You can draw images on the surface of a model by applying one or more textures to each shader. 

You can create a reference to a shader by using the shader property of the 3D Member object. The 
shader property gets the shader at a specified index position in the list of shaders. In Lingo, you 
use the shader property directly from the 3D Member object to create a reference. In JavaScript 
syntax, you must use the getPropRefO method to create a reference. 

The following example creates a reference to the second shader of the 3D cast member triangle 
and assigns it to the variable my Shader. 

-- Lingo syntax 

myShader = member!"triangle").shader[2] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myShader = member!"triangle").getPropRef!"shader", 2); 

Sprite 

Represents a 3D sprite created from a Shockwave 3D cast member. 

You can create a reference to a 3D sprite by using the top level sprite! ) function, the Movie 
object’s sprite property, or the Sprite Channel object’s sprite property. These are the same 
techniques you can use to create a reference to a non-3D sprite. 

• Use the top level sprite!) function. 

-- Lingo syntax 

3dSpri te = spri ted) 

// JavaScript syntax 
var 3dSprite = sprite(l); 

• Use the Movie object’s sprite property. 

-- Lingo syntax 

3dSprite = _movie.sprite["wi 11 owTree" ] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var 3dSprite = _movie.sprite["wi 11 owTree"]; 

• Use the Sprite Channel object’s sprite property.

Texture 

Represents the texture applied to a shader. 

You can create a reference to a texture by using the texture property of the 3D Member object. 
The texture property gets the texture at a specified index position in the list of textures. In 
Lingo, you use the texture property directly from the 3D Member object to create a reference. In 
JavaScript syntax, you must use the getPropRef () method to create a reference. 

The following example creates a reference to the first texture of the 3D cast member triangle 
and assigns it to the variable my Texture. 

-- Lingo syntax 

myTexture = member("triangle").texture[l] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myTexture = member!"triangle").getPropRef("texture", 1);

CHAPTER 9 

Constants 


This section provides an alphabetical list of all the constants available in Macromedia Director 
MX 2004. 

The majority of these constants apply only to Lingo. JavaScript syntax does contain some 
constants that are similar to the Lingo constants listed here; therefore, where appropriate, 
JavaScript syntax usage and examples are provided to help you map the functionality of Lingo 
constants with their closest counterparts in JavaScript syntax. For more information about 
JavaScript syntax constants, see one of the many third-party resources on the subject. 

(string) 

Usage 

--Lingo syntax 
// JavaScript syntax 

Description 

String constant; when used before and after a string, quotation marks indicate that the string is a 
literal—not a variable, numerical value, or script element. Quotation marks must always 
surround literal names of cast members, casts, windows, and external files. 

Example 

This statement uses quotation marks to indicate that the string “San Francisco” is a literal string, 
the name of a cast member: 

--Lingo syntax 

put memberC'San Franci sco"). 1 oaded 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(member("San Francisco").loaded); 

See also 

QUOTE 


151 



BACKSPACE 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
BACKSPACE 

// JavaScript syntax 

51 // value of _key.keyCode 

Description 

Constant; represents the Backspace key. This key is labeled Backspace in Windows and Delete on 
the Macintosh. 

Example 

This on key Down handler checks whether the Backspace key was pressed and, if it was, calls the 
handler cl earEntry: 

--Lingo syntax 
on keyDown 

if (_key.key = BACKSPACE) then clearEntry 
_movie.stopEventl) 
end keyDown 

// JavaScript syntax 
function keyDownO { 

if (_key.keyCode ==51) { 
clearEntry(); 

_movi e.stopEventO; 

1 

1 


EMPTY 

Usage 

--Lingo syntax 
EMPTY 

// JavaScript syntax 


Description 

Character constant; represents the empty string, "", a string with no characters. 

Example 

This statement erases all characters in the field cast member Notice by setting the field to EMPTY: 
--Lingo syntax 

member("Notice").text = EMPTY 

// JavaScript syntax 
member("Notice").text = 


152 Chapter 9: Constants 



ENTER 


Usage 

--Lingo syntax 
ENTER 

// JavaScript syntax 
3 // value of _key.keyCode 

Description 

Character constant; represents Enter (Windows) or Return (Macintosh) for a carriage return. 

On PC keyboards, the element ENTER refers only to Enter on the numeric keypad. 

For a movie that plays back as an applet, use RETURN to specify both Return in Windows and 
Enter on the Macintosh. 

Example 

This statement checks whether Enter is pressed and if it is, sends the playhead to the frame 

addSum: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on keyDown 

if (_key.key = ENTER) then _movie.go("addSum") 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function keyDownO { 

if (_key.keyCode == 3) { 

_movie.go("addSum"); 

1 

1 

See also 

RETURN (constant) 


ENTER 153 



FALSE 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
FALSE 

// JavaScript syntax 
fal se 

Description 

Constant; applies to an expression that is logically FALSE, such as 2 > 3. When treated as a 
number value, FALSE has the numerical value of 0. Conversely, 0 is treated as FALSE. 

Example 

This statement turns off the soundEnabl ed property by setting it to FALSE: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_sound.soundEnabled = FALSE 

// JavaScript syntax 
_sound.soundEnabled = false; 

See also 

if, not, TRUE 


PI 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
PI 

// JavaScript syntax 
Hath.PI 

Description 

Constant; returns the value of pi (7t), the ratio of a circles circumference to its diameter, as a 
floating-point number. The value is rounded to the number of decimal places set by the 
fl oatPreci si on property. 

Example 

This statement uses the PI constant as part of an equation for calculating the area of a circle: 

-- Lingo syntax 
vRadius = 3 

vArea = PI*power(vRadius, 2) 
trace(vArea) - - results in 28.2743 

// JavaScript syntax 
var vRadius = 3; 

vArea = Math.PI*Math.pow(vRadius, 2); 
trace(vArea); // results in 28.274333882308138 


154 Chapter 9: Constants 



QUOTE 

Usage 

--Lingo syntax 
QUOTE 

// JavaScript syntax 
V 

Description 

Constant; represents the quotation mark character and refers to the literal quotation mark 
character in a string, because the quotation mark character itself is used by Lingo scripts to 
delimit strings. 

Example 

This statement inserts quotation mark characters in a string: 

-- Lingo syntax 

putt"Can you spell" && QUOTE & "Macromedia" & QUOTE & "?") 

// JavaScript syntax 

putC'Can you spell V'MacromediaV?"); 

The result is a set of quotation marks around the word Macromedia-. 

Can you spell "Macromedia"? 


QUOTE 155 



RETURN (constant) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
RETURN 

// JavaScript syntax 

36 // value of _key.keyCode 

\n // when used in a string 

Description 

Constant; represents a carriage return. 

Example 

This statement causes a paused movie to continue when the user presses the carriage return: 
-- Lingo syntax 

if (_key.key = RETURN) then _movie.go(_movie.frame + 1) 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_key.keyCode ==36) I 

_movie.go(_movie.frame + 1); 

) 


This statement uses the RETURN character constant to insert a carriage return between two lines in 
an alert message: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.alert("Last line in the file." & RETURN & "Click OK to exit.") 

// JavaScript syntax 

_player.alert("Last line in the file.XnClick OK to exit"); 

In Windows, it is standard practice to place an additional line-feed character at the end of 
each line. This statement creates a two-character string named CRLF that provides the 
additional line feed: 

CRLF = RETURN & numToChar(10) 

SPACE 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
SPACE 

// JavaScript syntax 

49 // value of _key.keyCode 

Description 

Constant; read-only, value that represents the space character. 

Example 

This statement displays “Age Of Aquarius” in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put("Age"&SPACE&"Of"&SPACE&"Aquari us") 


156 Chapter 9: Constants 



TAB 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
TAB 

// JavaScript syntax 

48 // value of _key.keyCode 

Description 

Constant; represents the Tab key. 

Example 

This statement checks whether the character typed is the tab character and calls the handler 
doNextFi el d if it is: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_key.key = TAB) then doNextField 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_key.keyCode == 48) { 
doNextFi el d(); 

1 


These statements move the playhead forward or backward, depending on whether the user presses 
Tab or Shift+Tab: 

-- Lingo syntax 
if (_key.key = TAB) then 
if (_key.shiftDown) then 
_movie.go(_movie.frame - 1) 
el se 

_movie.go(_movie.frame + 1) 
end i f 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_key.keyCode == 48) ( 
if (_key.shiftDown) I 

_movie.go(_movie.frame - 1); 

1 else 1 

_movie.go(_movie.frame + 1); 


See also 

BACKSPACE, EMPTY, RETURN (constant) 


TAB 157 



TRUE 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
TRUE 

// JavaScript syntax 
true 

Description 

Constant; represents the value of a logically true expression, such as 2 < 3. It has a traditional 
numerical value of 1, but any nonzero integer evaluates to TRUE in a comparison. 

Example 

This statement turns on the soundEnabled property by setting it to TRUE: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_sound.soundEnabled = TRUE 

// JavaScript syntax 
_sound.soundEnabled = true; 

See also 

FALSE, if 

VOID 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
VOID 

// JavaScript syntax 
nul 1 

Description 

Constant; indicates the value VOID. 

Example 

This statement checks whether the value in the variable currentVariable is VOID: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if currentVariable = VOID then 

putC'This variable has no value") 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (currentVariable == null) { 

putC'This variable has no value");

on activateApplication 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on activateApplication 
statementi s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function activateApplication!) { 
statementi s ); 

1 


Description 

Built-in handler; runs when the projector is brought to the foreground. This handler is useful 
when a projector runs in a window and the user can send it to the background to work with other 
applications. When the projector is brought back to the foreground, this handler runs. Any 
MIAWs running in the projector can also make use of this handler. 

During authoring, this handler is called only if Animate in Background is turned on in 
General Preferences. 

On Windows, this handler is not called if the projector is merely minimized and no other 
application is brought to the foreground. 


159 



Example 


This handler plays a sound each time the user brings the projector back to the foreground: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on activateApplication 

sound(1).queue(member("openSound")) 
sound(1).piay() 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function activateApplication() { 

sound(1).queue(member("openSound")); 
sound(1).pi ay();

Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run in a movie when the user clicks 
the inactive window and the window comes to the foreground. 

You can use an on acti vateWi ndow handler in a script that you want executed every time the 
movie becomes active. 

Clicking the main movie (the main Stage) does not generate an on acti vateWi ndow handler. 

Example 

This handler plays the sound Hurray when the window that the movie is playing in 
becomes active: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on activateWindow 

sound(2).pi ay(member!"Hurray")) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function activateWindow() { 

sound(2).pi ay(member("Hurray"));

on beginSprite 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on beginSprite 
statement(s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function beginSprite() { 
statement(s); 

I 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run when the playhead moves to a 
frame that contains a sprite that was not previously encountered. Like endSpri te, this event is 
generated only one time, even if the playhead loops on a frame, since the trigger is a sprite not 
previously encountered by the playhead. The event is generated before prepareFrame. 

Director creates instances of any behavior scripts attached to the sprite when the begi nSpri te 
message is sent. 

The object reference me is passed to this event if it is used in a behavior. The message is sent to 
behaviors and frame scripts. 

If a sprite begins in the first frame that plays in the movie, the beginSprite message is sent after 
the prepareMovi e message but before the prepareFrame and startMovi e messages. 

Note: Be aware that some sprite properties, such as the rect sprite property, may not be accessible 
in a beginSprite handler. This is because the property needs to be calculated, which is not done until 
the sprite is drawn. 

The go, pi ay, and updateStage commands are disabled in an on begi nSpri te handler. 

Example 

This handler plays the sound cast member Stevie Wonder when the sprite begins: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on beginSprite me 

sound(1).pi ay(member("Stevie Wonder")) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function beginSprite() { 

sound(1).pi ay(member("Stevie Wonder"));

on closeWindow 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on closeWindow 
statement!s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function closeWindow() { 
statement!s); 

} 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run when the user closes the window 
for a movie by clicking the window’s close box. 

The on cl oseWi ndow handler is a good place to put Lingo commands that you want executed 
every time the movie’s window closes. 

Example 

This handler tells Director to forget the current window when the user closes the window that 
the movie is playing in: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on closeWindow 

-- perform general housekeeping here 
window(1).forget!) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function closeWindow!) { 

// perform general housekeeping here 
window!1).forget!); 


on cuePassed 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

on cuePassed!(me,1 channel ID, cuePointNumber,cuePointName) 
statement(s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function cuePassedichannelID, cuePointNumber,cuePointName) { 
statement(s); 

1 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run each time a sound or sprite 
passes a cue point in its media. 

• me The optional me parameter is the scri ptlnstanceRef value of the script being invoked. 
You must include this parameter when using the message in a behavior. If this parameter is 
omitted, the other arguments will not be processed correctly. 


162 Chapter 10: Events and Messages 



• channe 1 ID The number of the sound or sprite channel for the file where the cue 
point occurred. 

• cuePoi ntNumber The ordinal number of the cue point that triggers the event in the list of 
the cast member’s cue points. 

• cuePointName The name of the cue point that was encountered. 

The message is passed—in order—to sprite, cast member, frame, and movie scripts. For the sprite 
to receive the event, it must be the source of the sound, like a QuickTime movie or SWA cast 
member. Use the isPastCuePoint property to check cues in behaviors on sprites that don’t 
generate sounds. 

Example 

This handler placed in a Movie or Frame script reports any cue points in sound channel 1 to the 
Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 

on cuePassed channel, number, name 
if (channel = #Soundl) then 

put("CuePoint" && number && "named" && name && "occurred in sound 1”) 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function cuePassed(channel, number, name) 1 
if (channel == symbol("Soundl")) { 

put("CuePoint " + number + " named " + name + "occurred in sound 1");

Description 

Built-in handler; runs when the projector is sent to the background. This handler is useful when 
a projector runs in a window and the user can send it to the background to work with other 
applications. Any MIAWs running in the projector can also make use of this handler. 

During authoring, this handler is called only if Animate in Background is turned on in 
General Preferences. 

On Windows, this handler is not called if the projector is merely minimized and no other 
application is brought to the foreground. 


on deactivateApplication 163 



Example 


This handler plays a sound each time the user sends the projector to the background: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on deactivateApplication 

sound(1).queue(member("cl oseSound")) 
sound!1).piay() 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function deactivateApplication() { 

sound!1).queue(member!"cl oseSound")); 
sound!1).pi ay();

Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run when the window that the movie 
is playing in is deactivated. The on deactivate event handler is a good place for Lingo that you 
want executed whenever a window is deactivated. 

Example 

This handler plays the sound Snore when the window that the movie is playing in is deactivated: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on deactivateWindow 

sound!2).pi ay(member!"Snore"))

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on endSprite 
statement(s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function endSpriteO { 
statement(s ); 

I 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains Lingo that runs when the playhead leaves a sprite 
and goes to a frame in which the sprite doesn’t exist. It is generated after exi tFrame. 

Place on endSprite handlers in a behavior script. 

Director destroys instances of any behavior scripts attached to the sprite immediately after the 
endSpri te event occurs. 

The event handler is passed the behavior or frame script reference me if used in a behavior. 
This endSpri te message is sent after the exi tFrame message if the playhead plays to the end 
of the frame. 

The go(), pi ay (), and updateStagef ) methods are disabled in an on endSpri te handler. 


168 Chapter 10: Events and Messages 








Example 

This handler runs when the playhead exits a sprite: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on endSprite me 
-- clean up 

gNumberOfSharks = gNumberOfSharks - 1 
sound(5),stop() 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function endSpriteO { 

// clean up 
gNumberOfSharks--; 
sound(5),stop();

on enterFrame 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on enterFrame 
statement(s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function enterFrame!) { 
statement(s); 

1 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run each time the playhead enters 

the frame. 

Place on enterFrame handlers in behavior, frame, or movie scripts, as follows: 

• To assign the handler to an individual sprite, put the handler in a behavior attached to 
the sprite. 

• To assign the handler to an individual frame, put the handler in the frame script. 

• To assign the handler to every frame (unless you explicitly instruct the movie otherwise), put 
the on enterFrame handler in a movie script. The handler executes every time the playhead 
enters a frame unless the frame script has its own handler. If the frame script has its own 
handler, the on enterFrame handler in the frame script overrides the on enterFrame handler 
in the movie script. 

The order of frame events is step Frame, prepareFrame, enterFrame, and exi t Frame. 

This event is passed the object reference me if used in a behavior. 


on enterFrame 169 




Example 


This handler turns off the puppet condition for sprites 1 through 5 each time the playhead enters 
the frame: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on enterFrame 

repeat with i = 1 to 5 

_movie.puppetSprite(i, FALSE) 
end repeat 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function enterFrame!) ( 
for (i=l;i<=5;i++) 1 

_movie.puppetSprite(i, false): 



on EvalScript 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on EvalScript aParam 
statement(s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function EvalScript (aParam) { 
statement(s ); 

1 


Description 

System message and event handler; in a movie with Macromedia Shockwave content, contains 
statements that run when the handler receives an Eval Seri pt message from a browser. The 
parameter is a string passed in from the browser. 

• The Eval Seri pt message can include a string that Director can interpret as a Lingo statement. 
Lingo cannot accept nested strings. If the handler you are calling expects a string as a 
parameter, pass the parameter as a symbol. 

• The on Eval Seri pt handler is called by the Eval Seri pt( ) scripting method from JavaScript 
or VBScript in a browser. 

Include only those behaviors in on Eval Seri pt that you want users to control; for security 
reasons, don’t give complete access to behaviors. 

Note: If you place a return at the end of your EvalScript handler, the value returned can be used by 
JavaScript in the browser. 


170 Chapter 10: Events and Messages 



Example 

This shows how to make the playhead jump to a specific frame depending on what frame is 
passed in as the parameter: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on EvalScript aParam 
_movie.go(aParam) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function EvalScript(aParam) { 

_movie.go(aParam); 

1 


This handler runs the statement _mo v i e. g o (a P a r a m) if it receives an EvalScript message that 
includes dog, cat, or tree as an argument: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on EvalScript aParam 
case aParam of 

"dog", "cat”, "tree": _movie.go(aParam) 
end case 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function EvalScript(aParam) { 
switch(aParam) { 

case "dog", "cat", "tree": _movie.go(aParam); 

1 

1 


A possible calling statement for this in JavaScript would be Eval Seri pt ("dog"). 

This handler takes an argument that can be a number or symbol: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on EvalScript aParam 

if word 1 of aParam = "myHandler" then 
_movie.go(aParam) 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function EvalScript(aParam) { 

if (aParam.indexOfl"myHandler",0)) { 

_movie.go(aParam); 

1 

1 


The following handler normally requires a string as its argument. The argument is received as a 
symbol and then converted to a string within the handler by the string function: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on myHandler aParam 

_movie.go(string(aParam)) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function myHandler(aParam) { 

_movi e.go(aParam.toStringO);

on exitFrame 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame 
statementi s ) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFrameO { 
statementi s ); 

} 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run each time the playhead exits the 
frame that the on exi tFrame handler is attached to. The on exi tFrame handler is a useful place 
for Lingo that resets conditions that are no longer appropriate after leaving the frame. 

Place on exi tFrame handlers in behavior, frame, or movie scripts, as follows: 

• To assign the handler to an individual sprite, put the handler in a behavior attached to 
the sprite. 

• To assign the handler to an individual frame, put the handler in the frame script. 

• To assign the handler to every frame unless explicitly instructed otherwise, put the handler in a 
movie script. The on exi tFrame handler then executes every time the playhead exits the frame 
unless the frame script has its own on exitFrame handler. When the frame script has its own 
on exi tFrame handler, the on exi tFrame handler in the frame script overrides the one in the 
movie script. 

This event is passed the sprite script or frame script reference me if it is used in a behavior. The 
order of frame events is prepareFrame, enterFrame, and exi tFrame. 

Example 

This handler turns off all puppet conditions when the playhead exits the frame: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame me 

repeat with i = 48 down to 1 
sprite(i).scripted = FALSE 
end repeat 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFrameO I 
for (i=48; i>=l; i—) ; 

sprite(i).scripted = false; 


172 Chapter 10: Events and Messages 



This handler branches the playhead to a specified frame if the value in the global variable 
vTotal exceeds 1000 when the playhead exits the frame: 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFrameO { 

if (_global.vTotal > 1000) 1 
_movie.go("Finished");

on getBehaviorDescription 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on getBehaviorDescription 
statement(s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function getBehaviorDescription!) { 
statement(s ); 

1 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains Lingo that returns the string that appears in a 
behavior’s description pane in the Behavior Inspector when the behavior is selected. 

The description string is optional. 

Director sends the getBehavi orDescri pti on message to the behaviors attached to a sprite when 
the Behavior inspector opens. Place the on getBehavi orDescri pti on handler within a behavior. 

The handler can contain embedded Return characters for formatting multiple-line descriptions. 

Example 

This statement displays “Vertical Multiline textField Scrollbar” in the description pane: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on getBehaviorDescription 

return "Vertical Multiline textField Scrollbar" 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function getBehaviorDescriptionC) { 

return "Vertical Multiline textField Scrollbar";

! 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains Lingo that returns the string that appears in a tooltip 
for a script in the Library palette. 

Director sends the getBehavi orTool ti p message to the script when the cursor stops over it in 
the Library palette. Place the on getBehavi orTool ti p handler within the behavior. 

The use of the handler is optional. If no handler is supplied, the cast member name appears in 
the tooltip. 

The handler can contain embedded Return characters for formatting multiple-line descriptions. 

Example 

This statement displays “Jigsaw puzzle piece” in the description pane: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on getBehaviorTooltip 

return "Jigsaw puzzle piece" 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function getBehaviorTooltip!) { 
return "Jigsaw puzzle piece";

174 Chapter 10: Events and Messages 



Description 


System message and event handler; contains Lingo that generates a list of definitions and labels 
for the parameters that appear in a behavior’s Parameters dialog box. 

Place the on getPropertyDescri pti onLi st handler within a behavior script. Behaviors that 
don’t contain an on getPropertyDescri pti onLi st handler don’t appear in the Parameters 
dialog box and can’t be edited from the Director interface. 

The on getPropertyDescri pti onLi st message is sent when any action that causes the 
Behavior Inspector to open occurs: either when the user drags a behavior to the Score or the user 
double-clicks a behavior in the Behavior inspector. 

The #def aul t, #format, and //comment settings are mandatory for each parameter. The 
following are possible values for these settings: 

//default The parameter’s initial setting. 

//format //integer //float //string //symbol //member //bitmap //filmloop //field //palette 

//picture //sound //button //shape //movie //di gi tal video //script //richtext 
//ole //transition //xtra //frame //marker //ink //boolean 

//comment A descriptive string that appears to the left of the parameter's editable field in the 

Parameters dialog box. 

//range A range of possible values that can be assigned to a property. The range is 

specified as a linear list with several values or as a minimum and maximum in the 
form of a property list: [//mi n: minValue, //max: maxValue], 


Example 

The following handler defines a behavior’s parameters that appear in the Parameters dialog box. 
Each statement that begins with addProp adds a parameter to the list named description. Each 
element added to the list defines a property and the property’s //def aul t, //format, and 
//comment values: 

on getPropertyDescriptionList 
description = [:] 

descri pti on . addProp(//dynami c, [//def aul t: 1, //format ://bool ean , \ 

//comment:"Dynami c" ]) 

descri pti on . addProp(//f i el dNum, [//def aul t: 1, //format ://i nteger , \ 

//comment: "Scroll which sprite:"]) 

description. addProp(//extentSpri te, [//def aul t: 1 .//format ://i nteger , \ 

//comment: "Extend Sprite:"]) 

descri pti on . add Prop (//pro port i onal , [//def aul t: 1 .//format ://bool ean , \ 
//comment: "Proportional:"]) 
return description

Description 

System message and event handler; used to determine when a hyperlink is actually clicked. 

This event handler has the following parameters: 

• me Used in a behavior to identify the sprite instance 

• data The hyperlink data itself; the string entered in the Text inspector when editing the text 
cast member 

• range The character range of the hyperlink in the text (It’s possible to get the text of the 
range itself by using the syntax member Ref.char[range[l]..range[2]] 

This handler should be attached to a sprite as a behavior script. Avoid placing this handler in a 
cast member script. 

Example 

This behavior shows a link examining the hyperlink that was clicked, jump to a URL if needed, 
then output the text of the link itself to the message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
property spriteNum 

on hyperlinkClicked(me, data, range) 
if data starts "http://" then 
gotoNetPage(data) 
end i f 

currentMember = sprite(spriteNum).member 
anchorstring = currentMember.char[rangell]..range[2]] 
putC'The hyperlink on"&&anchorString&&"was just clicked.") 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function hyperlinkClicked(data, range) { 
var st = data.siice(0,7); 
var ht = "http://"; 
if (st = ht) { 

gotoNetPageldata);

on idle 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on idle 

statement(s) 

end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function idle!) { 
statement(s); 

) 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run whenever the movie has no other 
events to handle and is a useful location for Lingo statements that you want to execute as 
frequently as possible, such as statements that update values in global variables and displays 
current movie conditions. 

Because statements in on idle handlers run frequently, it is good practice to avoid placing Lingo 
that takes a long time to process in an on idle handler. 

It is often preferable to put on idle handlers in frame scripts instead of movie scripts to take 
advantage of the on idle handler only when appropriate. 

Director can load cast members from an internal or external cast during an idle event. However, 
it cannot load linked cast members during an idle event. 

The idle message is only sent to frame scripts and movie scripts. 

Example 

This handler updates the time being displayed in the movie whenever there are no other events to 
handle: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on idle 

member!"Time").text = _system.time() 
end idle 

// JavaScript syntax 
function idle!) { 

member!"Time").text = _system.time();

on isOKToAttach 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

on isOKToAttach me, aSpriteType, aSpriteNum 
statement(s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function isOKToAttach( aSpriteType, aSpriteNum ) { 
statement(s) 

} 


Description 

Built-in handler; you can add this handler to a behavior in order to check the type of sprite the 
behavior is being attached to and prevent the behavior from being attached to inappropriate 
sprite types. 

When the behavior is attached to a sprite, the handler executes and Director passes to it the type 
of the sprite and its sprite number. The me argument contains a reference to the behavior that is 
being attached to the sprite. 

This handler runs before the on getPropertyDescri pti on Li st handler. 

The Lingo author can check for two types of sprites. #g r a p h i c includes all graphic cast members, 
such as shapes, bitmaps, digital video, text, and so on. #scri pt indicates the behavior was 
attached to the script channel. In this case, the spri teNum is 1. 

For each of these sprite types, the handler must return TRUE or FALSE. A value of TRUE indicates 
that the behavior can be attached to the sprite. A value of FALSE prevents the behavior from being 
attached to the sprite. 

If the behavior contains no on i sOKToAttach handler, then the behavior can be attached to any 
sprite or frame. 

This handler is called during the initial attachment of the behavior to the sprite or script channel 
and also when attaching a new behavior to a sprite using the Behavior inspector. 

Example 

This statement checks the sprite type the behavior is being attached to and returns TRUE for any 
graphic sprite except a shape and FALSE for the script channel: 

-- Lingo syntax 

on isOKToAttach me, aSpriteType, aSpriteNum 
case aSpriteType of 

^graphic: -- any graphic sprite type 

return sprite(aSpriteNum).member.type <> #shape 
-- works for everything but shape cast members 
#script: --the frame script channel 

return FALSE -- doesn't work as a frame script 
end case 
end

// JavaScript syntax 

function isOKToAttach(aSpriteType, aSpriteNum) { 
switch (aSpriteType) { 

case symbol("graphic"): // any graphic sprite type

// works for everything but shape cast members 
case symbol("script"): // the frame script channel 
return false; // doesn't work as a frame script

on keyDown 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on keyDown 
statementts) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function keyDown!) { 
statement(s); 

1 

Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run when a key is pressed. 

When a key is pressed, Director searches these locations, in order, for an on keyDown handler: 
primary event handler, editable field sprite script, field cast member script, frame script, and 
movie script. For sprites and cast members, on keyDown handlers work only for editable text and 
field members. A keyDown event on a different type of cast member, such as a bitmap, has no 
effect. (If pressing a key should have the same response throughout the movie, set 
keyDownScri pt.) 

Director stops searching when it reaches the first location that has an on keyDown handler, 
unless the handler includes the pass command to explicitly pass the keyDown message on to the 
next location. 

The on keyDown event handler is a good place to put Lingo that implements keyboard shortcuts 
or other interface features that you want to occur when the user presses keys. 

When the movie plays back as an applet, an on keyDown handler always traps key presses, even if 
the handler is empty. If the user is typing in an editable field, an on keyDown handler attached to 
the field must include the pass command for the key to appear in the field. 

Where you place an on keyDown handler can affect when it runs. 

• To apply the handler to a specific editable field sprite, put the handler in a sprite script. 

• To apply the handler to an editable field cast member in general, put the handler in a cast 

member script. 

• To apply the handler to an entire frame, put the handler in a frame script. 

• To apply the handler throughout the entire movie, put the handler in a movie script. 


on keyDown 179 



You can override an on keyDown handler by placing an alternative on keyDown handler in a 
location that Lingo checks before it gets to the handler you want to override. For example, you 
can override an on keyDown handler assigned to a cast member by placing an on keyDown 
handler in a sprite script. 

Example 

This handler checks whether the Return key was pressed and if it was, sends the playhead to 
another frame: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on keyDown 

if (_key.key = RETURN) then _movie.go("AddSum") 
end keyDown 

// JavaScript syntax 
function keyDown!) { 

if (_key.keyCode ==36) { 

_movie.go("AddSum");

on keyLIp 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on keyUp 

statement(s) 

end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function keyUp!) { 
statement(s); 

1 

Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run when a key is released. The on 
keyUp handler is similar to the on keyDown handler, except this event occurs after a character 
appears if a field or text sprite is editable on the screen. 

When a key is released, Lingo searches these locations, in order, for an on keyUp handler: primary 
event handler, editable field sprite script, field cast member script, frame script, and movie script. 
For sprites and cast members, on keyUp handlers work only for editable strings. A keyUp event on 
a different type of cast member, such as a bitmap, has no effect. If releasing a key should always 
have the same response throughout the movie, set keyUpScri pt. 

Lingo stops searching when it reaches the first location that has an on keyUp handler, unless the 
handler includes the pass command to explicitly pass the keyUp message on to the next location. 

The on keyUp event handler is a good place to put Lingo that implements keyboard shortcuts or 
other interface features that you want to occur when the user releases keys. 


180 Chapter 10: Events and Messages 



When the movie plays back as an applet, an on key Up handler always traps key presses, even if the 
handler is empty. If the user is typing in an editable field, an on keyUp handler attached to the 
field must include the pass command for the key to appear in the field. 

Where you place an on keyUp handler can affect when it runs, as follows: 

• To apply the handler to a specific editable field sprite, put it in a behavior. 

• To apply the handler to an editable field cast member in general, put it in a cast member script. 

• To apply the handler to an entire frame, put it in a frame script. 

• To apply the handler throughout the entire movie, put it in a movie script. 

You can override an on keyUp handler by placing an alternative on keyUp handler in a location 
that Lingo checks before it gets to the handler you want to override. For example, you can 
override an on keyUp handler assigned to a cast member by placing an on keyUp handler in a 
sprite script. 

Example 

This handler checks whether the Return key was released and if it was, sends the playhead to 
another frame: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on keyUp 

if (_key.key = RETURN) then _movie.go("AddSum")

Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run when the mouse button 
is pressed. 


on mouseDown (event handler) 181 



When the mouse button is pressed, Lingo searches the following locations, in order, for an on 
mouseDown handler: primary event handler, sprite script, cast member script, frame script, and 
movie script. Lingo stops searching when it reaches the first location that has an on mouseDown 
handler, unless the handler includes the pass command to explicitly pass the mouseDown message 
on to the next location. 

To have the same response throughout the movie when pressing the mouse button, set 
mouseDownScri pt or put a mouseDown handler in a Movie script. 

The on mouseDown event handler is a good place to put Lingo that flashes images, triggers sound 
effects, or makes sprites move when the user presses the mouse button. 

Where you place an on mouseDown handler can affect when it runs. 

• To apply the handler to a specific sprite, put it in a sprite script. 

• To apply the handler to a cast member in general, put it in a cast member script. 

• To apply the handler to an entire frame, put it in a frame script. 

• To apply the handler throughout the entire movie, put it in a movie script. 

You can override an on mouseDown handler by placing an alternative on mouseDown handler in a 
location that Lingo checks before it gets to the handler you want to override. For example, you 
can override an on mouseDown handler assigned to a cast member by placing an on mouseDown 
handler in a sprite script. 

If used in a behavior, this event is passed the sprite script or frame script reference me. 

Example 

This handler checks whether the user clicks anywhere on the Stage and sends the playhead to 
another frame if a click occurs: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown 

if (_mouse.clickOn = 0) then _movie.go("AddSum")

on mouseEnter 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseEnter 
statement(s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseEnterO { 
statement(s); 

) 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run when the mouse pointer first 
contacts the active area of the sprite. The mouse button does not have to be pressed. 

If the sprite is a bitmap cast member with matte ink applied, the active area is the portion of the 
image that is displayed; otherwise, the active area is the sprite’s bounding rectangle. 

If used in a behavior, this event is passed the sprite script or frame script reference me. 

Example 

This example is a simple button behavior that switches the bitmap of the button when the mouse 
rolls over and then off the button: 

-- Lingo syntax 
property spriteNum 


on mouseEnter me 

-- Determine current cast member and switch to next in cast 
currentMember = sprite(spriteNum).member.number 
sprite(spriteNum).member = currentMember + 1 
end 


on mouseLeave me 

-- Determine current cast member and switch to previous in cast 
currentMember = sprite(spriteNum).member.number 
sprite(spriteNum).member = currentMember - 1 


// JavaScript syntax 
var spriteNum; 

function mouseEnter!) { 

// Determine current cast member and switch to next in cast 
currentMember = sprite(spriteNum).member.number; 
sprite(spriteNum).member = currentMember + 1; 


function mouseLeave!) { 

// Determine current cast member and switch to previous in cast

Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run when the mouse leaves the active 
area of the sprite. The mouse button does not have to be pressed. 

If the sprite is a bitmap cast member with the matte ink applied, the active area is the portion of 
the image that is displayed; otherwise, the active area is the sprite’s bounding rectangle. 

If used in a behavior, this event is passed the sprite script or frame script reference me. 


Example 

This statement shows a simple button behavior that switches the bitmap of the button when the 
mouse pointer rolls over and then back off the button:

on mouseUp (event handler) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseUp 
statementts) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseUpO { 
statementts); 

} 

Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that are activated when the mouse button 
is released. 

When the mouse button is released, Lingo searches the following locations, in order, for an on 
mouseUp handler: primary event handler, sprite script, cast member script, frame script, and 
movie script. Lingo stops searching when it reaches the first location that has an on mouseUp 
handler, unless the handler includes the pass command to explicitly pass the mouseUp message on 
to the next location. 

To create the same response throughout the movie when the user releases the mouse button, set 
the mouseUpScript. 

An on mouseUp event handler is a good place to put Lingo that changes the appearance of 
objects—such as buttons—after they are clicked. You can do this by switching the cast member 
assigned to the sprite after the sprite is clicked and the mouse button is released. 

Where you place an on mouseUp handler can affect when it runs, as follows: 

• To apply the handler to a specific sprite, put it in a sprite script. 

• To apply the handler to a cast member in general, put it in a cast member script. 

• To apply the handler to an entire frame, put it in a frame script. 

• To apply the handler throughout the entire movie, put it in a movie script. 

You can override an on mouseUp handler by placing an alternative on mouseUp handler in a 
location that Lingo checks before it gets to the handler you want to override. For example, you 
can override an on mouseUp handler assigned to a cast member by placing an on mouseUp 
handler in a sprite script. 

If used in a behavior, this event is passed the sprite script or frame script reference me. 


on mouseUp (event handler) 185 



Example 


This handler, assigned to sprite 10, switches the cast member assigned to sprite 10 when the user 
releases the mouse button after clicking the sprite: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseUp 

sprite(10).member = member!"Dimmed") 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseUp!) {

Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run when the mouse is within the 
active area of the sprite. The mouse button does not have to be pressed. 

If the sprite is a bitmap cast member with the matte ink applied, the active area is the portion of 
the image that is displayed; otherwise, the sprite’s bounding rectangle is the active area. 

If used in a behavior, this event is passed the sprite script or frame script reference me. 

Example 

This statement displays the mouse location when the mouse pointer is over a sprite: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseWithin 

membert"Display").text = string(_mouse.mouseH)

on prepareFrame 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on prepareFrame 
statement(s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function prepareFrame { 
statement(s); 

) 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run immediately before the current 
frame is drawn. 

Unlike begi nSpri te and endSpri te events, a prepareFrame event is generated each time the 
playhead enters a frame. 

The on prepareFrame handler is a useful place to change sprite properties before the sprite 
is drawn. 

If used in a behavior, the on prepareFrame handler receives the reference me. 

The go, pi ay, and updateStage commands are disabled in an on prepareFrame handler. 

Example 

This handler sets the 1 ocH property of the sprite that the behavior is attached to: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on prepareFrame me 

sprite(me.spriteNum).locH = _mouse.mouseH 
end

on prepareMovie 189 



Description 


System message and event handler; contains statements that run after the movie preloads cast 
members but before the movie does the following: 

• Creates instances of behaviors attached to sprites in the first frame that plays. 

• Prepares the first frame that plays, including drawing the frame, playing any sounds, and 
executing transitions and palette effects. 

New global variables used for sprite behaviors in the first frame should be initialized in the 
on prepareMovie handler. Global variables already set by the previous movie do not need to 
be reset. 

An on prepa reMo v i e handler is a good place to put Lingo that creates global variables, initializes 
variables, plays a sound while the rest of the movie is loading into memory, or checks and adjusts 
computer conditions such as color depth. 

The go, pi ay, and updateStage commands are disabled in an on prepareMovi e handler. 

Example 

This handler creates a global variable when the movie starts: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on prepareMovie 

global currentScore 
currentScore = 0 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function prepareMovie!) 1

on sendXML 


Usage

on sendXML "sendxmlstring", "window", "postdata" 
statementts) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function sendXML( sendxmlstring, window, postdata ) { 
statement(s ); 

I 

Description 

Event handler; functions much like the getURL scripting method, which is also available using the 
Macromedia Flash Asset Xtra extension. The on sendXML handler is called in Lingo when the 
XMLobject. send ActionScript method is executed in a Flash sprite or Flash XML object. 

In ActionScript, the XMLobject . send method passes two parameters in addition to the XML 
data in the XML object. These parameters are as follows: 

• ur 1 —the URL to send the XML data to. Usually this is the URL of a server script that is 
waiting to process the XML data. 

• window —the browser window in which to display the server’s response data. 

The ActionScript XMLobject. send method can be called in Director either by a Flash sprite or by 
a global Flash XML object created in Lingo. When this happens, the Lingo on sendXML handler 
is called, and the same parameters are passed to the handler. 

The following Lingo illustrates how the parameters are received by the on sendXML handler: 

on sendXML me, theURL, targetWindow, XMLdata 

These parameters correlate with the XMLobject. send parameters as follows: 

• theURL—the URL to send the XML data to. 

• ta rgetWi ndow —the browser window in which to display the server’s response. 

• XMLdata —the XML data in the Flash XML object. 

By creating an on sendXML handler in your Director movie, you enable it to process 
XMLobject. send events generated in a Flash sprite or a global Flash object. 

Flash sprites can also load external XML data or parse internal XML data. The Flash Asset 
Xtra extension handles these functions in the same way as Flash 5 or Flash MX content in 
your browser. 

Example 

This Lingo command gets the XMLobject . send method information from a Flash sprite and 
then directs the browser to the URL and transmits the XML data to the URL: 

-- Lingo syntax 

on sendXML me, theURL, targetWindow, xmlData 
gotoNetPage(theURL, targetWindow) 
postNetText(theURL, xmlData) 
end

on startMovie 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on startMovie 
statement(s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function startMovie!) { 
statement(s); 

) 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run just before the playhead enters 
the first frame of the movie. The startMovi e event occurs after the prepare Frame event and 
before the enterFrame event. 

An on startMovie handler is a good place to put Lingo that initializes sprites in the first frame of 
the movie. 

Example 

This handler makes sprites invisible when the movie starts: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on startMovie 

repeat with counter = 10 to 50 
sprite(counter).visible = 0 
end repeat 
end startMovie 

// JavaScript syntax 
function startMovie!) { 

for!counter=10;counter<=50;counter++) { 
sprite(counter).visible = 0;

on stepFrame 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on stepFrame 
statement! s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function stepFrame!) { 
statementts); 

} 


Description 

System message and event handler; works in script instances in actorLi st because these are the 
only objects that receive on stepFrame messages. This event handler is executed when the 
playhead enters a frame or the Stage is updated. 

An on stepFrame handler is a useful location for Lingo that you want to run frequently for a 
specific set of objects. Assign the objects to actorLi st when you want Lingo in the on 
stepFrame handler to run; remove the objects from actorLi st to prevent Lingo from running. 
While the objects are in actorLi st, the objects’ on stepFrame handlers run each time the 
playhead enters a frame or the updateStage command is issued. 

The stepFrame message is sent before the prepareFrame message. 

Assign objects to actorLi st so they respond to stepFrame messages. Objects must have an on 
stepFrame handler to use this built-in functionality with actorLi st. 

The go, pi ay, and updateStage commands are disabled in an on stepFrame handler. 

Example 

If the child object is assigned to actorLi st, the on stepFrame handler in this parent script 
updates the position of the sprite that is stored in the mySpri te property each time the playhead 
enters a frame: 

-- Lingo syntax 
property mySprite 

on new me, theSprite 
mySprite = theSprite 
return me 
end 

on stepFrame me 

spritetmySprite). 1 oc = point(random!640),random(480)) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

// define a constructor class that contains the mySprite property 
function FrameltheSprite) { 
this .mySprite = theSprite;

function stepFrame!) { 

var myFrame = new Frame!sprite( spriteName). spriteNum); 
sprite!my Frame.mySprite).1oc = point(random!640),random(480));

on stopMovie 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on stopMovie 
statement(s) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function stopMovieO { 
statement(s); 

) 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run when the movie stops playing. 

An on stopMovi e handler is a good place to put Lingo that performs cleanup tasks—such as 
closing resource files, clearing global variables, erasing fields, and disposing of objects—when the 
movie is finished. 

An on stopMovie handler in a MIAW is called only when the movie plays through to the end or 
branches to another movie. It isn’t called when the window is closed or when the window is 
deleted by the forget wi ndow command. 

Example 

This handler clears a global variable when the movie stops: 

-- Lingo syntax 
global gCurrentScore 

on stopMovie 

gCurrentScore = 0 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
_globa1.gCurrentScore; 

function stopMovie!) { 

_global.gCurrentScore = 0;

on streamStatus 197 



Description 


System message and event handler; called periodically to determine how much of an object has 
been downloaded from the Internet. The handler is called only ifteTIStreamStatus (TRUE) 
has been called, and the handler has been added to a movie script. 

The on streamStatus event handler has the following parameters: 


URL Displays the Internet address of the data being retrieved. 

state Displays the state of the stream being downloaded. Possible values are Connecting, 

Started, InProgress, Compl ete, and Error. 

bytesSoFar Displays the number of bytes retrieved from the network so far. 


bytesTota 1 Displays the total number of bytes in the stream, if known. The value may be 0 if the 
HTTP server does not include the content length in the MIME header. 

error Displays an empty string ("") if the download has not finished; OK (OK) if the 

download completed successfully; displays an error code if the download was 
unsuccessful. 


These parameters are automatically filled in by Director with information regarding the progress 
of the download. The handler is called by Director automatically, and there is no way to control 
when the next call will be. If information regarding a particular operation is needed, call 

getStreamStatus(). 

You can initiate network streams using Lingo commands, by linking media from a URL, or by 
using an external cast member from a URL. A streamStatus handler will be called with 
information about all network streams. 

Place the streamStatus handler in a movie script. 

Example 

This handler determines the state of a streamed object and displays the URL of the object: 

-- Lingo syntax 

on streamStatus URL, state, bytesSoLar, bytesTotal 
if state = "Complete" then 

put(URL && "download finished") 
end i f 

end streamStatus 
// JavaScript syntax 

function streamStatus(URL, state, bytesSoLar, bytesTotal) ( 
if (state == "Complete") { 

put(URL + " download finished");

on timeOut 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
on timeOut

} 


Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that run when the keyboard or mouse is 
not used for the time period specified in ti meOutLength . Always place an on ti meOut handler 
in a movie script. 

To have a timeout produce the same response throughout a movie, use the ti meoutScri pt to 
centrally control timeout behavior. 

Example 

The following handler plays the movie Attract Loop after users do nothing for the time set in the 
ti meoutLength property. It can be used to respond when users leave the computer. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on timeOut 

_movie.pi ay("Attract Loop")

// JavaScript syntax 
function timeOutO { 

_movie.pi ay("Attract Loop");

Description 

System message and event handler; contains statements that execute whenever a movie running as 
a movie in a window (MIAW) is resized. This happens when the user clicks the Minimize or 
Maximize button (Windows) or the Zoom button (Macintosh). The operating system determines 
the dimensions after resizing the window. 


on zoomWindow 201 



An on zoomWi ndow event handler is a good place to put Lingo that rearranges sprites when 
window dimensions change. 

Example 

This handler moves sprite 3 to the coordinates stored in the variable centerPlace when the 
window that the movie is playing in is resized: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on zoomWindow 

centerPlace = point(10, 10) 
spri ted). 1 oc = centerPlace

CHAPTER 11 

Keywords 


This section provides an alphabetical list of all the keywords available in Macromedia Director 
MX 2004. 

These keywords apply only to Lingo. JavaScript syntax does contain some keywords and 
constructs that are similar in function to the following Lingo keywords, but they are not 
documented here. For more information about JavaScript syntax keywords and constructs, see 
Chapter 2, “Director Scripting Essentials,” on page 9. 


\ (continuation) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

first part of a statement on this line \ 
second part of the statement \ 
third part of the statement 

Description 

Continuation symbol; when used as the last character in a line, indicates that the statement 
continues on the next line. Lingo then interprets the lines as one continuous statement. 

Example 

This statement uses the \ character to wrap the statement onto two lines: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if sprite("mySprite").member = member!"myMember") then \ 

_player.alert("The sprite was created from myMember") 

case 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
case expression of 

expressionl: Statement 
expression2: Statement(s) 
expressions, expression4: Statement 
{otherwise: Statements)\ 
end case 


203 



Description 

Keyword; starts a multiple branching logic structure that is easier to write than repeated 
if. . .then statements. 

Lingo compares the value in case expression to the expressions in the lines beneath it, starting 
at the beginning and continuing through each line in order, until Lingo encounters an expression 
that matches case expression. 

When Lingo finds a matching expression, it executes the corresponding statement or statements 
that follow the colon after the matching expression. When only one statement follows the 
matching expression, the matching expression and its corresponding statement may appear on 
the same line. Multiple statements must appear on indented lines immediately below the 
matching expression. 

When more than one possible match could cause Lingo to execute the same statements, the 
expressions must be separated by commas. (The syntax line containing expressi on3 and 
expresssi on4 is an example of such a situation.) 

After Lingo encounters the first match, it stops testing for additional matches. 

If the optional otherwi se statement is included at the end of the case structure, the statements 
following otherwi se are executed if there are no matches. 

Example 

The following handler tests which key the user pressed most recently and responds accordingly. 

• If the user pressed A, the movie goes to the frame labeled Apple. 

• If the user pressed B or C, the movie performs the specified transition and then goes to the 
frame labeled Oranges. 

• If the user pressed any other key, the computer beeps. 

on keyDown 

case (_key.key) of 

"a": _movie.go("Appl e") 

" b", " c": 

_movie.puppetT ransition(99) 

_movie.got"Oranges") 
otherwise: _sound.beept) 
end case 
end keyDown 

This case statement tests whether the cursor is over sprite 1, 2, or 3 and runs the corresponding 
Lingo if it is: 

case _movie.roll Overt) of 

1: sound(l).play(member("Horn")) 

2: soundtD.pl ay (member ("Drum")) 

3: soundtD.pl ay (member ("Bongos")) 
end case 


204 Chapter 11: Keywords 




char...of 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

textMemberExpression . char[ whichCharacter] 
char whichCharacter of fieldOrStringVariable 
textMemberExpression .char[ firstCharacter. . 1astCharacter'] 
char firstCharacter to 1astCharacter of fieldOrStringVariable 

Description 

Keyword; identifies a character or a range of characters in a chunk expression. A chunk expression 
is any character, word, item, or line in any source of text (such as field cast members and variables) 
that holds a string. 

• An expression using whichCharacter identifies a specific character. 

• An expression using fi rstCha racter and 1 astCharacter identifies a range of characters. 

The expressions must be integers that specify a character or range of characters in the chunk. 
Characters include letters, numbers, punctuation marks, spaces, and control characters such as 
Tab and Return. 

You can test but not set the char. . .of keyword. Use the put... i nto command to modify the 
characters in a string. 

Example 

This statement displays the first character of the string §9.00: 

put(("$9.00").char[l..1]) 

-- "$" 

This statement displays the entire string §9.00: 

put(("$9.00").char[l..5]) 

-- "$9.00" 

This statement changes the first five characters of the second word in the third line of a text 
cast member: 

member!"quiz").1ine[3].word[2].char[l..5] = "?????"

end 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
end 

Description 

Keyword; marks the end of handlers and multiple-line control structures. 

Example 

The following mouseDown handler ends with an end mouseDown statement, 
on mouseDown 

_player.alert("The mouse was pressed") 
end mouseDown 

end case 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
end case 

Description 

Keyword; ends a case statement. 

Example 

This handler uses the end case keyword to end the case statement: 

on keyDown 

case (_key.key) of 

"a”: _movie.go("Appl e") 

" b", " c": 

_movie.puppetTransition(99) 

_movie.go("Oranges") 
otherwise: _sound.beep() 
end case 
end keyDown

case 


exit 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
exi t 

Description 

Keyword; instructs Lingo to leave a handler and return to where the handler was called. If the 
handler is nested within another handler, Lingo returns to the main handler. 


206 Chapter 11: Keywords 



Example 

The first statement of this script checks whether the monitor is set to black and white and then 
exits if it is: 

on setColors 

if _system.col orDepth = 1 then exit 
sprite(l).foreColor = 35 
end 

See also 

abort, haltO, quitO, pass, return (keyword) 

exit repeat 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
exit repeat 

Description 

Keyword; instructs Lingo to leave a repeat loop and go to the statement following the end 
repeat statement but to remain within the current handler or method. 

The exit repeat keyword is useful for breaking out of a repeat loop when a specified 
condition—such as two values being equal or a variable being a certain value—exists. 

Example 

The following handler searches for the position of the first vowel in a string represented by the 
variable testStri ng. As soon as the first vowel is found, the exi t repeat command instructs 
Lingo to leave the repeat loop and go to the statement return i: 

on findVowel teststring 

repeat with i = 1 to testString.char[testString.char.count] 
if "aeiou" contains testString.char[i] then exit repeat 
end repeat 
return i 
end

repeat while, repeat with 

field 

Usage 

f i el d( whichField) 

Description 

Keyword; refers to the field cast member specified by wh ichFi e 1 d. 

• When wh ; chFi eld is a string, it is used as the cast member name. 

• When wh i chFi eld is an integer, it is used as the cast member number. 

Character strings and chunk expressions can be read from or placed in the field. 


field 207 




The term field was used in earlier versions of Director and is maintained for backward 
compatibility. For new movies, use member to refer to field cast members. 

Example 

This statement places the characters 5 through 10 of the field name entry in the variable 

myKeyword: 

myKeyword = field("entry").char[5..10] 

This statement checks whether the user entered the word desk and, if so, goes to the frame 
deskBi d: 

if member!"bid") contains "desk" then _movie.go("deskBid") 

See also 

char. ..of, item. ..of, line. ..of, word...of 

global 

Usage 

global variablel {, variable2} (, variable3)... 

Description 

Keyword; defines a variable as a global variable so that other handlers or movies can share it. 

Every handler that examines or changes the content of a global variable must use the global 
keyword to identify the variable as global. Otherwise, the handler treats the variable as a local 
variable, even if it is declared to be global in another handler. 

Note: To ensure that global variables are available throughout a movie, declare and initialize them in 
the prepareMovi e handler. Then, if you leave and return to the movie from another movie, your global 
variables will be reset to the initial values unless you first check to see that they aren’t already set. 

A global variable can be declared in any handler or script. Its value can be used by any other 
handlers or scripts that also declare the variable as global. If the script changes the variable’s value, 
the new value is available to every other handler that treats the variable as global. 

A global variable is available in any script or movie, regardless of where it is first declared; it is not 
automatically cleared when you navigate to another frame, movie, or window. 

Any variables manipulated in the Message window are automatically global, even though they are 
not explicitly declared as such. 

Movies with Macromedia Shockwave content playing on the Internet cannot access global 
variables within other movies, even movies playing on the same HTML page. The only way 
movies can share global variables is if an embedded movie navigates to another movie and replaces 
itself through either goToNetMovi e or go movi e. 

Example 

The following example sets the global variable StartingPoint to an initial value of 1 if it doesn’t 
already contain a value. This allows navigation to and from the movie without loss of stored data. 

global gStartingPoint 
on prepareMovie 

if voidP(gStartingPoint) then gStartingPoint = 1 
end

if 1ogicalExpressionl then

end i f 

Description 

Keyword; if. . .then structure that evaluates the logical expression specified by 

1 ogi ca 1 Express i on. 

• If the condition is TRUE, Lingo executes the statement(s) that follow then. 

• If the condition is FALSE, Lingo executes the statement(s) following el se. If no statements 
follow else, Lingo exits the if. . .then structure. 

• All parts of the condition must be evaluated; execution does not stop at the first condition that 
is met or not met. Thus, faster code may be created by nesting if. . .then statements on 
separate lines instead of placing them all on the first line to be evaluated. 

When the condition is a property, Lingo automatically checks whether the property is TRUE. You 
don’t need to explicitly add the phrase = TRUE after the property. 

The el se portion of the statement is optional. To use more than one then-statement or 
el se-statement, you must end with the form end if. 

The el se portion always corresponds to the previous i f statement; thus, sometimes you must 
include an el se nothing statement to associate an el se keyword with the proper i f keyword. 

Note: A quick way to determine in the script window if a script is paired properly is to press Tab. This 
forces Director to check the open Script window and show the indentation for the contents. Any 
mismatches will be immediately apparent. 


if 209 



Example 


This statement checks whether the carriage return was pressed and then continues if it was: 
if the key = RETURN then go the frame + 1 

This handler checks whether the Command and Q keys were pressed simultaneously and, if so, 
executes the subsequent statements: 

on keyDown 

if (_key.commandDown) and (_key.key = "q") then 
cleanUp 
qui t 
end i f 
end keyDown 

Compare the following two constructions and the performance results. The first construction 
evaluates both conditions, and so must determine the time measurement, which may take a while. 
The second construction evaluates the first condition; the second condition is checked only if the 
first condition is TRUE. 

spriteUnderCursor = rollOverO 

if (spriteUnderCursor > 25) and MeasureTimeSinceIStarted() then 
_player.alert("You found the hidden treasure!”) 
end i f 

The alternate, and faster, construction would be as follows: 

spri teUnderCursor = rollOverO 
if (spriteUnderCursor > 25) then 
if MeasureTimeSinceIStarted() then 

_player . alert("You found the hidden treasure!") 
end i f 
end i f

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

textMemberExpression . i tem[whichltem] 
item whichltem of fieldOrStringVariable 
textMemberExpressi on . item \_fi rstltem. . last Item] 
item firstltem to lastltem of fieldOrStringVariable 


210 Chapter 11: Keywords 



Description 


Keyword; specifies an item or range of items in a chunk expression. An item in this case is 
any sequence of characters delimited by the current delimiter as determined by the 
i temDel imi ter property. 

The terms whi chltem, firstltem, and lastltem must be integers or integer expressions that 
refer to the position of items in the chunk. 

Chunk expressions refer to any character, word, item, or line in any source of strings. Sources of 
strings include field and text cast members and variables that hold strings. 

When the number that specifies the last item is greater than the item’s position in the chunk 
expression, the actual last item is specified instead. 

Example 

This statement looks for the third item in the chunk expression that consists of names of colors 
and then displays the result in the Message window: 

put("red,yel1ow,blue green,orange".itern[3]) 

-- "blue green" 

The result is the entire chunk “blue green” because this is the entire chunk between the commas. 

The following statement looks for the third through fifth items in the chunk expression. Because 
there are only four items in the chunk expression, only the third item is used and fourth items are 
returned. The result appears in the Message window. 

put("red,yellow,blue green.orange".item[3..5]) 

-- "blue green, orange" 

put item 5 of "red, yellow, blue green, orange" 


The following statement inserts the item Desk as the fourth item in the second line of the field 
cast member All Bids: 

memberC'All Bi ds"). 1 i ne[2]. i tem[4] = "Desk"

characters delimited by carriage returns, not by line breaks caused by text wrapping. 

The expressions whi chLi ne, firstLine, and lastLine must be integers that specify a line 
in the chunk. 


line...of 211 



Chunk expressions refer to any character, word, item, or line in any source of characters. Sources 
of characters include field cast members and variables that hold strings. 

Example 

This statement assigns the first four lines of the variable Acti on to the field cast member To Do: 
memberC'To Do").text = Action . 1 ine[l. .4] 

This statement inserts the word and after the second word of the third line of the string assigned 
to the variable Notes: 

put "and" after Notes.1ine[3].word[2]

loop (keyword) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.goLoopl) 

Description 

Keyword; refers to the marker. 

Example 

This handler loops the movie between the previous marker and the current frame: 

on exitFrame 
_movie.goLoopl) 
end exitFrame 


me 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
me 

Description 

Special variable; used within parent scripts and behaviors to refer to the current object that is an 
instance of the parent script or the behavior or a variable that contains the memory address of 
the object. 

The term has no predefined meaning in Lingo. The term me is used by convention. 

To see an example of me used in a completed movie, see the Parent Scripts movie in the Learning/ 
Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

The following statement sets the object myESi rdl to the script named Bird. The me keyword 
accepts the parameter script Bird and is used to return that parameter. 

myBirdl = new script("Bird") 

This is the on new handler of the Bird script: 


212 Chapter 11: Keywords 



on new me 
return me 
end 

The following two sets of handlers make up a parent script. The first set uses me to refer to the 
child object. The second set uses the variable myAddress to refer to the child object. In all other 
respects, the parent scripts are the same. 

This is the first set: 
property myData 

on new me, theData 
myData = theData 
return me 
end 

on stepFrame me 
ProcessData me 
end 

This is the second set: 
property myData 

on new myAddress, theData 
myData = theData 
return myAddress 
end 

on stepFrame myAddress 
ProcessData myAddress 
end

menu 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
menu: menuName 
itemName | script 
itemName j script 


or 

menu: menuName 
itemName I script 
itemName \ script 

[more menus ] 

Description 

Keyword; in conjunction with the instal 1 Menu command, specifies the actual content of custom 
menus. Field cast members contain menu definitions; refer to them by the cast member name 
or number. 


menu 213 



The menu keyword is followed immediately by a colon, a space, and the name of the menu. In 
subsequent lines, specify the menu items for that menu. You can set a script to execute when the 
user chooses an item by placing the script after the vertical bar symbol (|). A new menu is defined 
by the subsequent occurrence of the menu keyword. 

Note: Menus are not available in Shockwave Player. 

On the Macintosh, you can use special characters to define custom menus. These special 
characters are case-sensitive. For example, to make a menu item bold, the letter B must be 
uppercase. 

Special symbols should follow the item name and precede the vertical bar symbol (|). You can also 
use more than one special character to define a menu item. Using <B<U, for example, sets the 
style to Bold and Underline. 

Avoid special character formatting for cross-platform movies because not all Windows computers 
support it. 


Symbol 

Example 

Description 

@ 

menu: @ 

*On the Macintosh, creates the Apple symbol and enables Macintosh 
menu bar items when you define an Apple menu. 

! A 

iAEasy Select

Creates a disabled line in the menu. 


* identifies formatting tags that work only on the Macintosh. 


Example 

This example is the text of a field cast member named CustomMenu2 which can be used to 
specify the content of a custom File menu. To install this menu, use “i nstal 1 Menu 
memberf "CustomMenu2" )” while the movie is running. The Convert menu item runs the custom 
handler convertThi s.

NAN 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
NAN 

Description 

Return value; Indicates that a specified Lingo expression is not a number. 

This statement attempts to display the square root of -1, which is not a number, in the 
Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put((-1).sqrt) -- NAN 

See also

next 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
next 

Description 

Keyword; refers to the next marker in the movie and is equivalent to the phrase the marker 

(+ 1 ). 

Example 

This statement sends the playhead to the next marker in the movie: 

go next 

This handler moves the movie to the next marker in the Score when the right arrow key is pressed 
and to the previous marker when the left arrow key is pressed: 

on keyllp 

if (_key.keyCode = 124) then _movie.goNext() 
if (_key.keyCode = 123) then _movie.goPrevious() 
end keyllp 

See also 

loop (keyword), goPreviousO 


next 215 



next repeat 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
next repeat 

Description 

Keyword; sends Lingo to the next step in a repeat loop in a script. This function differs from that 
of the exi t repeat keyword. 

Example 

This repeat loop displays only odd numbers in the Message window: 

repeat with i = 1 to 10 

if (i mod 2) = 0 then next repeat 
put(i) 
end repeat 


on 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

on handlerName { argumentl ), ) arg2], { arg3) ... 

statement(s) 
end handlerName 

Description 

Keyword; indicates the beginning of a handler, a collection of Lingo statements that you can 
execute by using the handler name. A handler can accept arguments as input values and returns a 
value as a function result. 

Handlers can be defined in behaviors, movie scripts, and cast member scripts. A handler in a cast 
member script can be called only by other handlers in the same script. A handler in a movie script 
can be called from anywhere. 

You can use the same handler in more than one movie by putting the handlers script in a 
shared cast. 

otherwise 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
otherwise statement(s) 

Description 

Keyword; precedes instructions that Lingo performs when none of the earlier conditions in a 
case statement are met. 

This keyword can be used to alert users of out-of-bound input or invalid type, and can be very 
helpful in debugging during development. 


216 Chapter 11: Keywords 



Example 

The following handler tests which key the user pressed most recently and responds accordingly: 

• If the user pressed A, B, or C, the movie performs the corresponding action following the 
of keyword. 

• If the user pressed any other key, the movie executes the statement that follows the otherwi se 
keyword. In this case, the statement is a simple alert. 

on keyDown 

case (_key.key) of 

"a": _movie.goC"Apple") 

" b", " c": 

_movie.puppetTransition(99) 

_movie.got"Oranges") 

otherwise: _player.alertt"That is not a valid key.") 
end case 
end keyDown 

property 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

property { propertyl}{, property2 ) {,property3 I {...I 

Description 

Keyword; declares the properties specified by propertyl, property2, and so on as 
property variables. 

Declare property variables at the beginning of the parent script or behavior script. You can access 
them from outside the parent script or behavior script by using the the operator. 

Note: The spri teNum property is available to all behaviors and simply needs to be declared to be 
accessed. 

You can refer to a property within a parent script or behavior script without using the me 
keyword. However, to refer to a property of a parent script’s ancestor, use the form me . property. 

For behaviors, properties defined in one behavior script are available to other behaviors attached 
to the same sprite. 

You can directly manipulate a child object’s property from outside the object’s parent scripts 
through syntax similar to that for manipulating other properties. For example, this statement sets 
the moti onStyl e property of a child object: 
set the motionStyle of myBouncingObject to #frenetic 

Use the count function to determine the number of properties within the parent script of a child 
object. Retrieve the name of these properties by using getPropAt. Add properties to an object by 
using setaProp(). 

To see an example of property used in a completed movie, see the Parent Scripts movie in the 
Learning/Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

This statement lets each child object created from a single parent script have its own location and 
velocity setting: 

property location, velocity 


property 217 



This parent script handler declares pMySpri teNum a property to make it available: 

-- script Elder 
property pMyChannel 
on new me, whichSprite 

me . pMyChannel = whichSprite 
return me 
end 

The original behavior script sets up the ancestor and passes the spri teNum property to 
all behaviors: 

property spriteNum 
property ancestor 
on beginSprite me 

ancestor = new script("Elder", spriteNum) 
end 

See also 

me, ancestor, spriteNum 

put...after 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

put expression after chunkExpression 

Description 

Command; evaluates a Lingo expression, converts the value to a string, and inserts the resulting 
string after a specified chunk in a container, without replacing the container’s contents. (If 
chunkExpress i on specifies a nonexistent target chunk, the string value is inserted as appropriate 
into the container.) 

Chunk expressions refer to any character, word, item, or line in any container. Containers include 
field cast members; text cast members; variables that hold strings; and specified characters, words, 
items, lines, and ranges within containers. 

Example 

This statement adds the string “fox dog cat” after the contents of the field cast member Animal 
List: 

putC'fox dog cat") after member! "Animal List") 

The same can be accomplished using this statement: 

put "fox dog cat" after member!"Animal List").1ine[l] 

See also 

char. ..of, item. ..of, line. ..of, paragraph, word. ..of, put... before ,

218 Chapter 11: Keywords 




put...before 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

put expression before chunkExpression 

Description 

Command; evaluates a Lingo expression, converts the value to a string, and inserts the resulting 
string before a specified chunk in a container, without replacing the container’s contents. (If 
chunkExpress ion specifies a nonexistent target chunk, the string value is inserted as appropriate 
into the container.) 

Chunk expressions refer to any character, word, item, or line in any container. Containers include 
field cast members; text cast members; variables that hold strings; and specified characters, words, 
items, lines, and ranges in containers. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable a n i m a 1 L i s t to the string “fox dog cat” and then inserts the word 
elk before the second word of the list: 

put "fox dog cat" into animal List 
put "elk " before word 2 of animal List 

The result is the string “fox elk dog cat”. 

The same can be accomplished using this syntax: 

put "fox dog cat" into animal List 
put "elk " before animal List.word[2] 

See also 

char. ..of, item. ..of, line. ..of, paragraph, word. ..of, put. ..after, put...into 

put...into 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

put expression into chunkExpression 

Description 

Command; evaluates a Lingo expression, converts the value to a string, and uses the resulting 
string to replace a specified chunk in a container. (If chunkExpress i on specifies a nonexistent 
target chunk, the string value is inserted as appropriate into the container.) 

Chunk expressions refer to any character, word, item, or line in any container. Containers include 
field cast members; text cast members; variables that hold strings; and specified characters, words, 
items, lines, and ranges in containers. 

When a movie plays back as an applet, the put. . .into command replaces all text within a 
container, not chunks of text. 

To assign values to variables, use the set command. 


put...into 219 



Example 

This statement changes the second line of the field cast member Review Comments to “Reviewed 
by Agnes Gooch”: 

put "Reviewed by Agnes Gooch" into line 2 of member!"Review Comments") 

The same can be accomplished with a text cast member using this syntax: 

put "Reviewed by Agnes Gooch" into member!"Review Comments").1ineC2]

char. ..of, item. ..of, line. ..of, paragraph, word. ..of, put... before , 
put. ..after, set...to, set...= 

repeat while 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
repeat while testCondition 
statement(s) 
end repeat 

Description 

Keyword; repeatedly executes statement(s) so long as the condition specified by 
testCondi ti on is TRUE. This structure can be used in Lingo that continues to read strings until 
the end of a file is reached, checks items until the end of a list is reached, or repeatedly performs 
an action until the user presses or releases the mouse button. 

While in a repeat loop, Lingo ignores other events. To check the current key in a repeat loop, use 
the keyPressed property. 

Only one handler can run at a time. If Lingo stays in a repeat loop for a long time, other events 
stack up waiting to be evaluated. Therefore, repeat loops are best used for short, fast operations or 
when users are idle. 

If you need to process something for several seconds or more, evaluate the function in a loop with 
some type of counter or test to track progress. 

If the stop condition is never reached or there is no exit from the repeat loop, you can force 
Director to stop by using Control+Alt+period (Windows) or Command+period (Macintosh). 

Example 

This handler starts the timer counting, resets the timer to 0, and then has the timer count up to 
60 milliseconds: 

on countTime 

_system.milliseconds 
repeat while _system.mi 11 iseconds < 60 
-- waiting for time 
end repeat 
end countTime

220 Chapter 11: Keywords 



repeat with 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

repeat with counter = start to finish 
statement(s) 
end repeat 

Description 

Keyword; executes the Lingo specified by statement(s) the number of times specified by 
counter. The value of counter is the difference between the value specified by start and the 
value specified by finish. The counter is incremented by 1 each time Lingo cycles through the 
repeat loop. 

The repeat with structure is useful for repeatedly applying the same effect to a series of sprites 
or for calculating a series of numbers to some exponent. 

While in a repeat loop, Lingo ignores other events. To check the current key in a repeat loop, use 
the keyPressed property. 

Only one handler can run at a time. If Lingo stays in a repeat loop for a long time, other events 
stack up waiting to be evaluated. Therefore, repeat loops are best used for short, fast operations or 
when users are idle. 

If you need to process something for several seconds or more, evaluate the function in a loop with 
some type of counter or test to track progress. 

If the stop condition is never reached or there is no exit from the repeat loop, you can force 
Director to stop by using Control+Alt+period (Windows) or Command+period (Macintosh). 

Example 

This handler turns sprites 1 through 30 into puppets: 

on puppetize 

repeat with channel = 1 to 30 

_movie.puppetSprite(channel , TRUE) 
end repeat 
end puppetize 

See also 

exit, exit repeat, repeat while, repeat with...down to, repeat with...in list 

repeat with...down to 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

repeat with variable = startValue down to endValue 

Description 

Keyword; counts down by increments of 1 from startVa 1 ue to endVa 1 ue. 

Only one handler can run at a time. If Lingo stays in a repeat loop for a long time, other events 
stack up waiting to be evaluated. Therefore, repeat loops are best used for short, fast operations or 
when you know the user won’t be doing other things. 


repeat with...down to 221 



While in a repeat loop, Lingo ignores other events. To check the current key in a repeat loop, use 
the keyPressed property. 

If you need to process something for several seconds or more, evaluate the function in a loop with 
some type of counter or test to track progress. 

If the stop condition is never reached or there is no exit from the repeat loop, you can force 
Director to stop by using Control+Alt+period (Windows) or Command+period (Macintosh). 

Example 

This handler contains a repeat loop that counts down from 20 to 15: 

on countDown 

repeat with i = 20 down to 15 
sprite(6).member = 10 + i 
_movi e.updateStage() 
end repeat 
end 

repeat with...in list 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

repeat with variable in someList 

Description 

Keyword; assigns successive values from the specified list to the variable. 

While in a repeat loop, Lingo ignores other events except keypresses. To check the current key in 
a repeat loop, use the keyPressed property. 

Only one handler can run at a time. If Lingo stays in a repeat loop for a long time, other events 
stack up waiting to be evaluated. Therefore, repeat loops are best used for short, fast operations or 
when users are idle. 

If you need to process something for several seconds or more, evaluate the function in a loop with 
some type of counter or test to track progress. 

If the stop condition is never reached or there is no exit from the repeat loop, you can force 
Director to stop by using Control+Alt+period (Windows) or Command+period (Macintosh). 

Example 

This statement displays four values in the Message window: 

repeat with i in [1, 2, 3, 4] 
put(i) 
end repeat 


222 Chapter 11: Keywords 



return (keyword) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
return expression 

Description 

Keyword; returns the value of express i on and exits from the handler. The express ion 
argument can be any Lingo value. 

When calling a handler that serves as a user-defined function and has a return value, you must use 
parentheses around the argument lists, even if there are no arguments, as in the di ceRol 1 
function handler discussed under the entry for the result function. 

The function of the return keyword is similar to that of the exi t command, except that return 
also returns a value to whatever called the handler. The return command in a handler 
immediately exits from that handler, but it can return a value to the Lingo that called it. 

The use of return in object-oriented scripting can be difficult to understand. It’s easier to start by 
using return to create functions and exit handlers. Later, you will see that the return me line in 
an on new handler gives you a way to pass back a reference to an object that was created so it can 
be assigned to a variable name. 

The return keyword isn’t the same as the character constant RETURN, which indicates a carriage 
return. The function depends on the context. 

To retrieve a returned value, use parentheses after the handler name in the calling statement to 
indicate that the named handler is a function. 

To see an example of return ( keyword ) used in a completed movie, see the Parent 
Scripts movie in the Learning/Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

This handler returns a random multiple of 5 between 5 and 100: 

on getRandomScore 

theScore = 5 * random(20) 
return theScore 
end getRandomScore 

Call this handler with a statement similar to the following: 

thisScore = getRandomScore!) 

In this example, the variable thisScore is assigned the return value from the function 
getRandomScore! ). A parent script performs the same function: by returning the object 
reference, the variable name in the calling code provides a handle for subsequent references to 
that object.

return (keyword) 223 



s&t...to, s©t... = 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
1 7 ngoProperty = expression 
variable = expression 

Description 

Command; evaluates an expression and puts the result in the property specified by 
1 ingoProperty or the variable specified by variable. 

Example 

This statement sets the name of member 3 to Sunset: 
member(3).name = "Sunset" 

The following statement sets the soundEnabled property to the opposite of its current state. 
When soundEnabl ed is TRUE (the sound is on), this statement turns it off. When soundEnabl ed 
is FALSE (the sound is off), this statement turns it on. 

_sound.soundEnabled = not(_sound.soundEnabled) 

This statement sets the variable vowel s to the string “aeiou”: 
vowels = "aeiou" 

See also 

property 

sprite...intersects 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite!spritel).inter sects(sprite2) 
sprite spritel intersects sprite2 

Description 

Keyword; operator that compares the position of two sprites to determine whether the quad of 
spritel touches (TRUE) or does not touch (FALSE) the quad of sprite2. 

If both sprites have matte ink, their actual outlines, not the quads, are used. A sprite’s outline is 
defined by the nonwhite pixels that make up its border. 

This is a comparison operator with a precedence level of 5. 

Note: The dot operator is required whenever spritel is not a simple expression-that is, one that 
contains a math operation. 

Example 

This statement checks whether two sprites intersect and, if they do, changes the contents of the 
field cast member Notice to “You placed it correctly.”: 

if sprite i intersects j then put("You placed it correctly.") \ 
into member!"Notice") 

See also 

sprite...within, quad 


224 Chapter 11: Keywords 



sprite...within 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite( spritel ).within( sprite2) 
sprite spritel within sprite2 

Description 

Keyword; operator that compares the position of two sprites and determines whether the quad of 
spri tel is entirely inside the quad of spri te2 (TRUE) or not (FALSE). 

If both sprites have matte ink, their actual outlines, not the quads, are used. A sprite’s outline is 
defined by the nonwhite pixels that make up its border. 

This is a comparison operator with a precedence level of 5. 

Note: The dot operator is required whenever spritel is not a simple expression-that is, one that 
contains a math operation. 

Example 

This statement checks whether two sprites intersect and calls the handler do I ns i de if they do: 
if sprite(3).within(2) then dolnside 

See also 

sprite...intersects . quad 

version 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_player.productVersion 

Description 

Keyword; system variable that contains the version string for Director. The same string appears in 
the Macintosh Finder’s Info window. 

Example 

This statement displays the version of Director in the Message window: 

put C_piayer.productVersi on) 


version 225 



word...of 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

member( whichCastMember) . word[w/?7 chWord~\ 
textMember Expression . wo rd[ whichkJord ] 
chunkExpression. wordlwhi chWord] 
word whichWord of fieldOrStringVariable 
fieldOrStringVariable. word[ whichWordh

memberiwhichCastMember) .viordlfirstklord. . lastklordl 
word firstklord to lastkJord of chunkExpression 
chunkExpression .wordiwhi chklord. . lastklord~\ 

Description 

Chunk expression; specifies a word or a range of words in a chunk expression. A word chunk is 
any sequence of characters delimited by spaces. (Any non-visible character, such as a tab or 
carriage return, is considered a space.) 

The expressions whi chklord, fi rstk/ord, and 7 as tkJord must evaluate to integers that specify a 
word in the chunk. 

Chunk expressions refer to any character, word, item, or line in any source of characters. Sources 
of characters include field and text cast members and variables that hold strings. 

To see an example of word. . . of used in a completed movie, see the Text movie in the Learning/ 
Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

These statements set the variable named animal List to the string “fox dog cat” and then insert 
the word elk before the second word of the list: 

animal List = "fox dog cat" 

put "elk" before animal List.word[2] 

The result is the string “fox elk dog cat”. 

This statement tells Director to display the fifth word of the same string in the Message window: 
put "fox elk dog cat".word[5] 

Because there is no fifth word in this string, the Message window displays two quotation marks 
(""), which indicate an empty string.

Methods 


This section provides an alphabetical list of all the methods available in Director. 


abort 

Usage 

--Lingo syntax 
abort 

// JavaScript syntax 
abort(); 

Description 

Command; tells Lingo to exit the current handler and any handler that called it without 
executing any of the remaining statements in the handler. This differs from the exit keyword, 
which returns to the handler from which the current handler was called. 

The abort command does not quit Director. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement instructs Lingo to exit the handler and any handler that called it when the amount 
of free memory is less than 50K: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if the freeBytes < 50*1024 then abort 

// JavaScript syntax 

if (_piayer.freeBytes < 50*1024) { 

abort!) 

1 


See also 

exit, halt!), quit!) 


227 



abs() 

Usage 

--Lingo syntax 

abs ( numericExpression) 

// JavaScript syntax 
Math.abs (numericExpression) 

Description 

Math function (Lingo only); calculates the absolute value of a numerical expression. 

The abs () function has several uses. It can simplify the tracking of mouse and sprite movement 
by converting coordinate differences (which can be either positive or negative numbers) into 
distances (which are always positive numbers). The abs ( ) function is also useful for handling 
mathematical functions, such as sqrt( ) and 1 og(). 

In JavaScript syntax, use the Math object’s abs ( ) function. 

Parameters 

numericExpress ion Required. An integer or floating-point number from which an absolute 
value is calculated. If numeri cExpressi on is an integer, the absolute value is also an integer. If 
numeri cExpressi on is a floating-point number, the absolute value is also a floating-point 
number. 

Example 

This statement determines whether the absolute value of the difference between the current 
mouse position and the value of the variable sta rtV is greater than 30 (since you wouldn’t want 
to use a negative number for distance). If it is, the foreground color of sprite 6 is changed. 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (the mouseV - startVKabs > 30 then sprite(6).forecolor = 95 
// JavaScript syntax 

if ((_mouse.mouseV - Math.abs(_mouse.startV)) > 30) { 
sprite(6).foreColor = 95; 


activateAtl_oc() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

dvdObjRef. activateAtLoc( poi nt (x, y)) 

// JavaScript syntax 

dvdObjRef .acti vateAtLoc( poi nt(x, y)); 

Description 

DVD method; activates the hilite of the embedded DVD menu item that is under a specified 
Stage location. 

This method returns 0 if successful. 


228 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters 


poi nt ("x, y) Required. A point that specifies the location of the embedded DVD menu item. 

Example 

This statement activates the hilite of the menu item at a specified Stage location: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"moviel").activateAtLoc(point(100, 200)) 

// JavaScript syntax

addProp 

Usage 

1ist.addProp!property, value) 
addProp list, property, value 

Description 

Property list command; for property lists only, adds a specified property and its value to a 
property list. 

For an unsorted list, the value is added to the end of the list. For a sorted list, the value is placed in 
its proper order. 

If the property already exists in the list, both Lingo and JavaScript syntax create a duplicate 
property. You can avoid duplicate properties by using the setaPropO command to change the 
new entry’s property. 

This command returns an error when used with a linear list. 

Parameters 

property Required. The property to add to the list, 
i /a 1 ue Required. The value of the property to add to the list. 

Example 

This statement adds the property named kayne and its assigned value 3 to the property list 
named bids, which contains [#gee: 4, #ohasi: 1]. Because the list is sorted, the new entry is 
placed in alphabetical order: 

bids.addProp(#kayne, 3) 

The result is the list [#gee: 4, #kayne: 3, #ohasi: 1], 

This statement adds the entry kayne : 7 to the list named bids, which now contains [#gee: 4, 
#kayne: 3, #ohasi: 1], Because the list already contains the property kayne, Lingo creates a 
duplicate property: 

bids.addProp(#kayne, 7) 

The result is the list [#gee: 4, #kayne: 3, #kayne: 7, #ohasi: 1],

beginRecording() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.beginRecording() 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.beginRecording(); 

Description 

Movie method; starts a Score generation session. 

When you call begi nRecordi ng(), the playhead automatically advances one frame and begins 
recording in that frame. To avoid this behavior and begin recording in the frame in which 
begi nRecordi ng() is called, place a statement such as _movi e . go(_movi e . frame - 1) between 
the calls to begi nRecordi ng() and endRecordi ng(). 

Only one update session in a movie can be active at a time. 

Every call to begi nRecordi ng() must be matched by a call to endRecordi ng(), which ends the 
Score generation session. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

When used in the following handler, the begi nRecordi ng keyword begins a Score generation 
session that animates the cast member Ball by assigning the cast member to sprite channel 20 and 
then moving the sprite horizontally and vertically over a series of frames. The number of frames is 
determined by the argument numberOfFrames.

browserName() 

Usage 

browserName pathName 
browserNamet) 

browserName(#enabled, trueOrFa1se) 

Description 

System property, command, and function; specifies the path or location of the browser. You can 
use the FilelO Xtra to display a dialog box that allows the user to search for a browser. The 
di spl ayOpen () method of the FilelO Xtra is useful for displaying an Open dialog box. 

The form browserNamet ) returns the name of the currently specified browser. Placing a 
pathname, like one found using the FilelO Xtra, as an argument in the form 
browserNamet ful 1 PathToAppl i cati on ) allows the property to be set. The form 
browserName(#enabl ed , trueOrFa 1 se) determines whether the specified browser launches 
automatically when the goToNetPage command is issued.

build() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

member! whichCastmember) .model Resource! whichModelResource) .build!) 

// JavaScript syntax 

member! whichCastmember) .model Resource! whichModelResource) .build!); 

Description 

3D mesh command; constructs a mesh. This command is only used with model resources whose 
type is #mesh. 

You must use the build! ) command in the initial construction of the mesh, after changing any 
of the face properties of the mesh, and after using the generateNormal s () command. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This example creates a simple model resource whose type is #mesh, specifies its properties, and 
then creates a new model using the model resource. The process is outlined in the following line- 
by-line explanation of the example code: 

Line 1 creates a mesh called Plane, which has one face, three vertices, and a maximum of three 
colors. The number of normals and the number of texture coordinates are not set. The normals 
are created by the generateNormal s command. 

Line 2 defines the vectors that will be used as the vertices for Plane. 

Line 3 assigns the vectors to the vertices of the first face of Plane. 

Line 4 defines the three colors allowed by the newMesh command. 

Line 5 assigns the colors to the first face of Plane. The third color in the color list is applied to the 
first vertex of Plane, the second color to the second vertex, and the first color to the third vertex. 
The colors will spread across the first face of Plane in gradients. 

Line 6 creates the normals of Plane with the generateNormals!) command. 


build() 247 



Line 7 calls the bui 1 d() command to construct the mesh. 

-- Lingo syntax 

nm = member!"Shapes").newMesh!"PIane",1,3,0,3,0) 

nm.vertexList = [vector(0,0,0), vector(20,0,0), vector(20, 20, 0)] 
nm.faced] .vertices = [1,2,3]

// JavaScript syntax 
cacheDocVerify symbol (setting); 
cacheDocVerify(); 

Description 

Function; sets how often the contents of a page on the Internet are refreshed with information 
from the projector’s cache. 

The form cacheDocVeri fy () returns the current setting of the cache. 

The cacheDocVeri fy function is valid only for movies running in Director or as projectors. This 
function is not valid for movies with Macromedia Shockwave content because they use the 
network settings of the browser in which they run.

if (current == symbol("once")) { 

alert("Turning cache verification on"); 
cacheDocVerify(symbol("always")) 


Parameters 

cacheSetting Optional. A symbol that specifies how often the contents of a page on the Internet 
are refreshed. Possible values are #once (default) and #al ways. Specifying #once tells a movie to 
get a file from the Internet once and then use the file from the cache without looking for an 
updated version on the Internet. Specifying #a 1 way s tells a movie to try to get an updated version 
of the file each time the movie calls a URL.

call 

Usage 

call tthandlerName, script, 1 args...} 

call (tfhandlerName, scriptlnstance, 1 args...)) 

Description 

Command; sends a message that invokes a handler in a specified script or list of scripts. 

The call command can use a variable as the name of the handler. Messages passed using ca 11 are 
not passed to other scripts attached to the sprite, cast member scripts, frame scripts, or movie 
scripts. 

Parameters 

symHandl erName Required. A symbol that specifies the handler to activate. 

scri ptlnstance Required. A reference to the script or list of scripts that contains the handler. 

If scri ptlnstance is a single script instance, an error alert occurs if the handler is not defined 
in the script’s ancestor script. If scri ptlnstance is a list of script instances, the message is sent 
to each item in the list in turn; if the handler is not defined in the ancestor script, no alert 
is generated. 

args Optional. Any optional parameters to be passed to the handler. 

Example 

This handler sends the message bumpCounter to the first behavior script attached to sprite 1: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown me 

-- get the reference to the first behavior of sprite 1 
set xref = getAt (the scriptlnstanceList of sprite 1,1) 

-- run the bumpCounter handler in the referenced script, 

-- with a parameter 
call (#bumpCounter, xref, 2) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDownO { 

// get the reference to the first behavior of sprite 1 
xref = getAt(spri ted). scri pt(l) )i 

// run the bumpCounter handler in the referenced script 
cal 1(symbol ("bumpcounter"), xref, 2);

250 Chapter 12: Methods 



The following example shows how a cal 1 statement can call handlers in a behavior or parent 
script and its ancestor. 

• This is the parent script: 

-- Lingo syntax 
-- script Man 
property ancestor 
on new me 

set ancestor = newlscript "Animal", 2) 
return me 
end 

on run me, newTool 

put "Man running with "&the legCount of me&" legs" 
end 

• This is the ancestor script: 

-- script Animal 
property legCount 
on new me, newLegCount 

set legCount = newLegCount 
return me 
end 

on run me 

put "Animal running with "& legCount &" legs" 
end 

on walk me 

put "Animal walking with "& legCount &" legs" 
end 

• The following statements use the parent script and ancestor script. 

This statement creates an instance of the parent script: 

set m = newlscript "man") 

This statement makes the man walk: 
call #walk, m 

-- "Animal walking with 2 legs" 

This statement makes the man run: 

set msg = #run 
call msg, m 

-- "Man running with 2 legs and rock" 

This statement creates a second instance of the parent script: 
set m2 = new(script "man") 

This statement sends a message to both instances of the parent script: 

call msg, [m, m2] 

-- "Man running with 2 legs " 

-- "Man running with 2 legs " 


call 251 



callAncestor 


Usage 

callAncestor handlerName , script, largs... 1 

Description 

Command; sends a message to a child object’s ancestor script. 

Ancestors can, in turn, have their own ancestors.

bypass the handlers in the primary script and go directly to the ancestor script. 

Parameters 

symHandlerName Required. A symbol that specifies the handler to activate. 

scri ptlnstance Required. A reference to the script or list of scripts that contains the handler. 
If scri ptlnstance is a single script instance, an error alert occurs if the handler is not defined 
in the script’s ancestor script. If scri ptlnstance is a list of script instances, the message is sent 
to each item in the list in turn; if the handler is not defined in the ancestor script, no alert 
is generated. 

args Optional. Any optional parameters to be passed to the handler. 

Example 

This example shows how a cal 1 Ancestor statement can call handlers in the ancestor of a 
behavior or parent script. 

• This is the parent script: 

-- script "man" 
property ancestor 
on new me, newTool 

set ancestor = newlscript "Animal", 2) 
return me 
end 

on run me 

put "Man running with "&the legCount of me&"legs" 
end 

• This is the ancestor script: 

- - script "animal" 
property legCount 
on new me, newLegCount 

set legCount = newLegCount 
return me 
end 

on run me 

put "Animal running with "& legCount &" legs" 
end 

on walk me 

put "Animal walking with "& legCount &" legs" 
end 

• The following statements use the parent script and ancestor script. 

This statement creates an instance of the parent script:

charPosT oLoc() 

Usage 

--Lingo syntax 

memberObjRef. charPosToLoc( nthCharacter) 

// JavaScript syntax 

memberObjRef. charPosToLoc( nthCharacter ); 

Description 

Field function; returns the point in the entire field cast member (not just the part that appears on 
the Stage) that is closest to a specified character. This is useful for determining the location of 
individual characters. 

Values for charPosToLoc are in pixels from the top left corner of the field cast member. The 
nthCharacter parameter is 1 for the first character in the field, 2 for the second character, and 
so on. 

Parameters 

nthCharacter Required. The character to test. 

Example 

The following statement determines the point where the fiftieth character in the field cast 
member Headline appears and assigns the result to the variable location: 

-- Lingo syntax 

location = member!"Head!ine").charPosToLoc! 50) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var location = member!"Headline").charPosToLoc! 50); 

chars() 

Usage 

chars! stringExpression, firstCharacter, 1astCharacter) 

Description 

Function (Lingo only); identifies a substring of characters in an expression. 

The expressions fi rstCharacter and 1 astCharacter must specify a position in the string. 

If fi rstCharacter and 1 astCharacter are equal, then a single character is returned from the 
string. If 7 astCharacter is greater than the string length, only a substring up to the length of the 
string is identified. If 7 astCha racter is before fi rstCharacter, the function returns the value 
EMPTY. 

To see an example of cha rs () used in a completed movie, see the Text movie in the Learning/ 
Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

In JavaScript syntax, use the String object’s substr! ) function. 


258 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters 

stringExpress ion Required. A string that specifies the expression from which a substring is 
returned. 

firstCharacter Required. An integer that specifies the point at which the substring starts. 

1 astCharacter Required. An integer that specifies the point at which the substring ends. 

Example 

This statement identifies the sixth character in the word Macromedia-. 

put chars("Macromedia", 6, 6) 

- - " m" 

This statement identifies the sixth through tenth characters of the word Macromedia-. 

put chars("Macromedia", 6, 10) 

-- "media" 

The following statement tries to identify the sixth through twentieth characters of the word 
Macromedia. Because the word has only 10 characters, the result includes only the sixth through 
tenth characters. 

put chars ("Macromedia", 6, 20) 

-- "media"

char. ..of, length!), offset!) (string function), number (characters) 

charToNum() 

Usage 

( stringExpression) . charToNum 
charToNumt stringExpression) 

Description 

Function (Lingo only); returns the ASCII code that corresponds to the first character of an 
expression. 

The charToNumO function is especially useful for testing the ASCII value of characters created by 
combining keys, such as the Control key and another alphanumeric key. 

Director treats uppercase and lowercase letters the same if you compare them using the equal sign 
(=) operator; for example, the statement put CM" = "m" ) returns the result 1 or TRUE. 

Avoid problems by using charToNumt ) to return the ASCII code for a character and then use the 
ASCII code to refer to the character. 

In JavaScript syntax, use the String object’s charCodeAt( ) function. 

Parameters 

stri ngExpressi on Required. A string that specifies the expression to test. 


charToNumQ 259 




Example 


This statement displays the ASCII code for the letter A: 

put ("A").charToNum 
-- 65 

The following comparison determines whether the letter entered is a capital A, and then navigates 
to either a correct sequence or incorrect sequence in the Score: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on CheckKeyHit theKey 

if (theKey).charToNum = 65 then 
go "Correct Answer" 
el se 

go "Wrong Answer" 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax

clearAsObjects() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
clearAsObjects() 

// JavaScript syntax 
clearAsObjects(); 

Description 

Command; resets the global Flash Player used for ActionScript objects and removes any 
ActionScript objects from memory. The command does not clear or reset references to those 
objects stored in Lingo. Lingo references will persist but will refer to nonexistent objects. You 
must set each reference to VOID individually. 

The cl ea rAsOb jects () command affects only global objects, such as the array created in 
this statement: 

-- Lingo syntax 

myGlobalArray = newObject(#array) 

// JavaScript syntax 

myGl obal Array = new ArrayO; 

The cl ea rAsOb jects () command has no effect on objects created within sprite references, such 
as the following: 

myArray = sprite(2),newObject(#array) 


260 Chapter 12: Methods 





Parameters 


None. 

Example 

This statement clears all globally created ActionScript objects from memory: 

-- Lingo syntax

clearCache 

Usage 

clearCache 

Description 

Command; clears the Director network cache. 

The cl earCache command clears only the cache, which is separate from the browsers cache. 
If a file is in use, it remains in the cache until it is no longer in use. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This handler clears the cache when the movie starts: 

-- Lingo syntax

clearError() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. cl earError() 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. cl earError!); 

Description 

Flash command; resets the error state of a streaming Flash cast member to 0. 

When an error occurs while a cast member is streaming into memory, Director sets the cast 
members state property to -1 to indicate that an error occurred. When this happens, you can 
use the getError function to determine what type of error occurred and then use the 
cl ea rError command to reset the cast member’s error state to 0. After you clear the member’s 
error state, Director tries to open the cast member if it is needed again in the Director movie. 
Setting a cast member’s pathName, linked, and prel oad properties also automatically clears the 
error condition. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This handler checks to see if an out-of-memory error occurred for a Flash cast member named 
Dali, which was streaming into memory. If a memory error occurred, the script uses the 
unloadCast command to try to free some memory; it then branches the playhead to a frame in 
the Director movie named Artists, where the Flash movie sprite first appears, so Director can 
again try to play the Flash movie. If something other than an out-of-memory error occurred, the 
script goes to a frame named Sorry, which explains that the requested Flash movie can’t be played. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on CheckFlashStatus 

if (member!"Dal i"). getError!) =#memory) then 
member!"Dali").cl earError!) 
member!"Dali") .unload!)

member! whichCastmember). 1 ight! whichLight) .cl one! cloneName) 
member! whichCastmember) .camera( whichCamera) .clone! cloneName) 

Description 

3D command; creates a copy of the model, group, light, or camera and all of its children. The 
clone shares the parent of the model, group, light, or camera from which it was cloned. 

A clone of a model uses the same model resource and is assigned the same shaderList as the 
original model. 

If you do not specify the cl oneName, or if you specify "", the clone will not be counted by the 
count method, but it will appear in the scene. 

Parameters 

c 1 oneName Required. Specifies the name of the new clone. 

Example 

This statement creates a clone named Teapot2 from the model named Teapot, and returns a 
reference to the new model. 

teapotCopy = member("3D World").model("Teapot").cl one!"Teapot2")

close() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
windowObjRef. cl ose!) 

// JavaScript syntax 
windowObjRef. cl ose!); 

Description 

Window method; closes a window. 

Closing a window that is already closed has no effect. 


266 Chapter 12: Methods 



Be aware that closing a window does not stop the movie in the window nor clear it from memory. 
This method simply closes the window in which the movie is playing. You can reopen it quickly 
by using the open () (Wi ndow ) method. This allows rapid access to windows that you want to 
keep available. 

If you want to completely dispose of a window and clear it from memory, use the forget!) 
method. Make sure that nothing refers to the movie in that window if you use the forget!) 
method, or you will generate errors when scripts try to communicate or interact with the 
forgotten window. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement closes the window named Panel, which is in the subfolder MIAW Sources within 
the current movie’s folder: 

-- Lingo syntax 

window(_movie.path & "MIAW SourcesXPanel").close!) 

// JavaScript syntax 

wi ndow(_movi e. path + "MIAW SourcesMPanel"). cl ose!); 

This statement closes the window that is number 5 in wi ndow Li st: 

-- Lingo syntax 
window!5).close!) 

// JavaScript syntax

closeFileQ 267 



closeXlib 


Usage 

closeXlib whichFile 

Description 

Command; closes an Xlibrary file. 

Xtra extensions are stored in Xlibrary files. Xlibrary files are resource files that contain Xtra 
extensions. HyperCard XCMDs and XFCNs can also be stored in Xlibrary files. 

The closeXlib command doesn’t work for URLs. 

In Windows, using the DLL extension for Xtra extensions is optional. 

It is good practice to close any file you have opened as soon as you have finished using it. 

Note: This command is not supported in Shockwave Player. 

Parameters 

wh 7 chFI 1 e Optional. Specifies the Xlibrary file to close. If wh ichFi 1 e is in a folder other than 
that for the current movie, wh i chFi 1 e must specify a pathname. If whichFi 1 e is omitted, all 
open Xlibraries are closed. 

Example 

This statement closes all open Xlibrary files: 
closeXl ib 

This statement closes the Xlibrary Video Disc Xlibrary when it is in the same folder as the movie: 
closeXlib "Video Disc Xlibrary" 

The following statement closes the Xlibrary Transporter Xtra extensions in the folder New Xtras, 
which is in the same folder as the movie. The disk is identified by the variable currentDri ve: 

closeXlib "@:New Xtras:Transporter Xtras"

copyPixels() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

imageObjRef.copyPixelsisourcelmgObj, destRectOrQuad, sourceRect {, paramList )) 
// JavaScript syntax 

imageObjRef.copyPixelsisourcelmgObj, destRectOrQuad, sourceRect (, 
paramList 1); 

Description 

Image method. Copies the contents of a rectangle in an existing image object into a new 
image object. 

When copying pixels from one area of a cast member to another area of the same member, it is 
best to copy the pixels first into a duplicate image object before copying them back into the 
original member. Copying directly from one area to another in the same image is not 
recommended. 

To simulate matte ink with copy Pi xel s (), create a matte object with createMatteO and then 
pass that object as the #mask Image parameter of copy Pi xel s (). 


copyPixelsQ 271 



To see an example of quad used in a completed movie, see the Quad movie in the Learning/Lingo 
folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters 

sourcelmgObj Required. A reference to the source image object from which pixels are copied. 

destRectOrOuad Required if copying pixels into a screen coordinate rectangle or a floating point 
quad. The rectangle or quad into which pixels are copied. 

sourceRect Required. The source rectangle from which pixels are copied. 

paramL ist Optional. A parameter list that can be used to manipulate the copied pixels before 
they are placed into destRect or destQuad. The property list may contain any or all of the 
following parameters. 


Property Use and Effect 


//color The foreground color to apply for colorization effects. The default color is black. 

#bgCol or The background color to apply for colorization effects or background transparency. 
The default color is white. 


#i n k The type of ink to apply to the copied pixels. This can be an ink symbol or the 

corresponding numeric ink value. The default ink is //copy. 

#bl endLevel The degree of blend (transparency) to apply to the copied pixels. The range of 

values is from 0 to 255. The default value is 255 (opaque). Using a value less than 
255 forces the #ink setting to be #bl end, or #bl endTransparent if it was originally 
#backgroundTransparent. #blendLevel could also be replaced with #bl end; if so, use 
use a value range of 0 to 100. 

//di ther A TRUE or FALSE value that determines whether the copied pixels will be dithered 

when placed into the destRect in 8- and 16-bit images. The default value is FALSE, 
which maps the copied pixels directly into the imageObjRefs color palette. 


//useFastQuads A TRUE or FALSE value that determines whether quad calculations are made using the 
faster but less precise method available in Director when copying pixels into 
destQuad. Set to TRUE to use quads for simple rotation and skew operations. Set to 
FALSE for arbitrary quads, such as those used for perspective transformations. The 
default value is FALSE. 


//maskImage Specifies a mask or matte object, created with the creatMaskt ) or createMatteC )s, 

that will be used as a mask for the pixels being copied. This enables the effects of 
mask and matte sprite inks to be duplicated. If the source image has an alpha 
channel and its useAl pha property is TRUE, the alpha channel is used and the 
specified mask or matte is ignored. The default is no mask. 

//maskOffset A point indicating the amount of x and y offset to apply to the mask specified by 
//maskImage. The offset is relative to the upper left corner of the source image. The 
default offset is (0, 0). 


Example 

This statement copies the entire image of member Happy into the rectangle of member flower. If 
the members are different sizes, the image of member Happy will be resized to fit the rectangle of 
member flower. 


272 Chapter 12: Methods 



The following statement copies part of the image of member Happy into part of member flower. 
The part of the image copied from Happy is within rectangle(0, 0, 200, 90). It is pasted into 
rectangle(20, 20, 100, 40) within the image of member flower. The copied portion of Happy is 
resized to fit the rectangle into which it is pasted. 

The following statement copies the entire image of member Happy into a rectangle within the 
image of member flower. The rectangle into which the copied image of member Happy is pasted 
is the same size as the rectangle of member Happy, so the copied image is not resized. The blend 
level of the copied image is 50, so it is semi-transparent, revealing the part of member flower it is 
pasted over.

count() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
1ist. count 
object. count 

// JavaScript syntax 
1ist. count; 
object. count; 

Description 

Function; returns the number of entries in a linear or property list, the number of properties in a 
parent script without counting the properties in an ancestor script, or the chunks of a text 
expression such as characters, lines, or words. 

The count command works with linear and property lists, objects created with parent scripts, and 
the gl obal s property.

Fileio 

createMask() 

Usage 

imageObject. createMaski) 

Description 

This function creates and returns a mask object for use with the copy Pi xel s () function. 

Mask objects aren’t image objects; they’re useful only with the copy Pi xel s () function for 
duplicating the effect of mask sprite ink. To save time, if you plan to use the same image as a mask 
more than once, it’s best to create the mask object and save it in a variable for reuse. 

Example 

This statement copies the entire image of member Happy into a rectangle within the image of 
member brown square. Member gradient2 is used as a mask with the copied image. The mask is 
offset by 10 pixels up and to the left of the rectangle into which the image of member Happy 
is pasted. 

member!"brown square").image.copy Pixels(member("Happy").image, \ 
rect(20, 20, 150, 108), member("Happy").rect, \ 

[#maskImage:member("gradient2").image.createMaskO, maskOffset:point(-10, - 
10)])

createMatte() 

Syntax 

imageObject. createMatteUa 1 phaThreshold )) 

Description 

This function creates and returns a matte object that you can use with copy Pi xel s () to duplicate 
the effect of the matte sprite ink. The matte object is created from the specified image object’s 
alpha layer. The optional parameter a 1 pha Th res hoi d excludes from the matte all pixels whose 
alpha channel value is below that threshold. It is used only with 32-bit images that have an alpha 
channel. The a 1 pha Thresho 1 d must be a value between 0 and 255. 

Matte objects aren’t image objects; they are useful only with the copyPixelsO function. To save 
time, if you plan to use the same image as a matte more than once, it’s best to create the matte and 
save it in a variable for reuse. 

Example 

This statement creates a new matte object from the alpha layer of the image object testlmage and 
ignores pixels with alpha values below 50%: 

newMatte = testlmage.createMatte(128)

crop() (Image) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

imageObjRef. crop! rectToCropTo ) 

// JavaScript syntax 
imageObjRef. crop( rectToCropTo); 

Description 

Image method. Returns a new image object that contains a copy of a source image object, 
cropped to a given rectangle. 

Calling crop() does not alter the source image object. 

The new image object does not belong to any cast member and has no association with the Stage. 
To assign the new image to a cast member, set the image property of that cast member. 

Parameters 

rectToCropTo Required. The rectangle to which the new image is cropped. 

Example 

This Lingo takes a snapshot of the Stage and crops it to the rect of sprite 10, capturing the 
current appearance of that sprite on the Stage: 

This statement uses the rectangle of cast member Happy to crop the image of cast member 
Flower, then sets the image of cast member Happy to the result: 

member("Happy").image = member("FIower").image.crop(member("Happy").rect)

crop() (Bitmap) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. crop!) 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. crop!); 

Description 

Bitmap command; allows a bitmap cast member to be cropped to a specific size. 

You can use c rop to trim existing cast members, or in conjunction with the picture of the Stage to 
grab a snapshot and then crop it to size for display. 

The registration point is kept in the same location so the bitmap does not move in relation to the 
original position. 

Parameters 

rectToCropTo Required. Specifes the rectangle to which a cast member is cropped. 

Example 

This statement sets an existing bitmap member to a snapshot of the Stage, then crops the 
resulting image to a rectangle equal to sprite 10: 

-- Lingo syntax 

stagelmage = (_movie.stage). image 
spritelmage = stagelmage.crop(sprite(10).rect) 
membert"sprite snapshot").image = spritelmage 

// JavaScript syntax 

var stagelmage = (_movie.stage).image: 

var spritelmage = stagelmage.crop!sprite(10).rect); 

member("sprite snapshot").image = spritelmage;

_p layer.cursor! cursorMemRef) 

II JavaScript syntax 

_player.cursor !intCursorNum) ; 

_pl ayer.cursor! cursorMemNum, maskMemNum ); 

_player.cursor! cursorMemRef ); 

Description 

Player method; changes the cast member or built-in cursor that is used for a cursor and stays in 
effect until you turn it off by setting the cursor to 0. 

• Use the syntax _pl ayer. cursor! cursorMemNum, maskMemNum ) to specify the number of a 
cast member to use as a cursor and its optional mask. The cursors hot spot is the registration 
point of the cast member. 

The cast member that you specify must be a 1-bit cast member. If the cast member is larger 
than 16 by 16 pixels, Director crops it to a 16-by-16-pixel square, starting in the upper left 
corner of the image. The cursor’s hot spot is still the registration point of the cast member. 


278 Chapter 12: Methods 



• Use the syntax _pf ayer.cursor( cursorMemRef ) for the custom cursors available through the 
Cursor Xtra. 

Note: Although the Cursor Xtra allows cursors of different cast library types, text cast members 
cannot be used as cursors. 

• Use the syntax _pl ayer. cursor ( intCursorNum) to specify default system cursors. The term 
/ ntCursorNum must be one of the following integer values:

Custom 

During system events such as file loading, the operating system may display the watch cursor and 
then change to the pointer cursor when returning control to the application, overriding the 
cursor command settings from the previous movie. To use cursor () at the beginning of any 
new movie that is loaded in a presentation using a custom cursor for multiple movies, store any 
special cursor resource number as a global variable that remains in memory between movies. 


280 Chapter 12: Methods 



Cursor commands can be interrupted by an Xtra or other external agent. If the cursor is set to a 
value in Director and an Xtra or external agent takes control of the cursor, resetting the cursor to 
the original value has no effect because Director doesn’t perceive that the cursor has changed. To 
work around this, explicitly set the cursor to a third value and then reset it to the original value. 

Parameters 

f ntCursorNum Required when using an integer to identify a cursor. An integer that specifies the 
built-in cursor to use as a cursor. 

cursorMemNum Required when using a cast member number and its optional mask to identify the 
cursor. An integer that specifies the cast member number to use as a cursor. 

ma s kMemNum Required when using a cast member number and its optional mask to identify the 
cursor. An integer that specifies the mask number of cursorMemNum. 

cursorMemRef Required when using a cast member reference to identify the cursor. A reference 
to the cast member to use as a cursor. 

Example 

This statement changes the cursor to a watch cursor on the Macintosh, and hourglass in 
Windows, whenever the value in the variable named status equals 1: 

-- Lingo syntax syntax 
if (status = 1) then 
_player.cursor(4) 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (status == 1) { 

_player.cursor(4); 

1 


This handler checks whether the cast member assigned to the variable is a 1-bit cast member and 
then uses it as the cursor if it is: 

-- Lingo syntax syntax 
on myCursor(someMember) 

if (member(someMember).depth = 1) then 
_player.curs or(someMember) 
el se 

_sound.beep() 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function myCursor(someMember) { 

if (member(someMember).depth == 1) 1 
_player.cursor!someMember); 

1 

el se 1 

_sound . beep();

date() (formats) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax syntax 
date(I stringFormat)) 
date(( intFormat )) 

dat e({intYearFormat, intMonthFormat, intDayFormat]) 

II JavaScript syntax 

Date ((“month dd, yyyy hh:mm:ss ")); 

Date ((“month dd, yyyy”)); 

Date({ yy,mm,dd,hh,mm,ss)); 

Date( [yy,mm, dd )); 

Date(I williseconds }); 

Description 

Top level function and data type. Creates a standard, formatted date object instance for use with 
other date object instances in arithmetic operations and for use in manipulating dates across 
platforms and in international formats. 

Lingo date objects and JavaScript syntax date objects are different; therefore, Lingo date objects 
cannot be created using JavaScript syntax, and JavaScript syntax date objects cannot be created 
using Lingo syntax. 

Create a new JavaScript syntax Date object using the new Date( ) syntax. Case is important in 
JavaScript syntax. For example, using new date( ) results in a runtime error. 

When creating a date using Lingo, use four digits for the year, two digits for the month, 
and two digits for the day. The following expressions all return a date object equivalent to 
October 21, 2004. 


Date Format 

Usage 

string 

date(“20041021”) 

integer 

date( 20041021) 

comma separated 

date(2004, 10, 21) 

The individual properties of the returned date object are as follows. 

Property 

Description 

#year 

An integer representing the year 

fmonth 

An integer representing the month of the year 

#day 

An integer representing the day of the month 


Addition and subtraction operations on the date are interpreted as the addition and subtraction of 
days.

minute of the new Date object. Valid values range from 0 to 59. 

ss Optional when creating an JavaScript syntax Date object. A two-digit integer that specifies the 
seconds of the new Date object. Valid values range from 0 to 59. 

yy Optional when creating an JavaScript syntax Date object. A two-digit integer that specifies the 
year of the new Date object. Valid values range from 0 to 99. 

mill i seconds Optional when creating an JavaScript syntax Date object. An integer that specifies 
the milliseconds of the new Date object. Valid values range from 0 to 999. 

Example 

These statements create and determine the number of days between two dates: 

-- Lingo syntax syntax 
myBirthday = date(19650712) 
yourBirthday = date(19450529) 

put("There are" && abs(yourBirthday - myBirthday) && "days between our \ 
birthdays.") 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myBirthday = new Date(1965, 07, 12); 
var yourBirthday = new Date(1945, 05, 29); 

putC'There are " + Math.abs(((yourBirthday - myBirthday)/1000/60/60/24)) + 

" days between our birthdays."); 

These statements access an individual property of a date: 

-- Lingo syntax syntax 
myBirthday = date(19650712) 

putC’I was born in month number" && myBirthday .month) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myBirthday = new Date(1965, 07, 12);

date() (System) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_system.date( {yyyymmdd )) 

// JavaScript syntax 
_system.date({ yyyymmdd )); 

Description 

System method; returns the current date in the system clock. 

The format Director uses for the date varies, depending on how the date is formatted on the 
computer. 

• In Windows, you can customize the date display by using the International control panel. 
(Windows stores the current short date format in the System.ini file. Use this value to 
determine what the parts of the short date indicate.) 

• On the Macintosh, you can customize the date display by using the Date and Time 
control panel. 

Parameters 

yyyymmdd Optional. A number that specifies the four-digit year (yyyy), two-digit month (mm), 
and two-digit day (dd) of the returned date. 

Example 

This statement tests whether the current date is January 1 by checking whether the first four 
characters of the date are 1/1. If it is January 1, the alert “Happy New Year!” appears: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_system. date(). charYl.. 4] = "1/1/") then 
_player.alert("Happy New Year!") 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 

if (_system.date!).toString().substr(0, 4) == "1/1/") { 

_player.alert("Happy New Year!");

delay() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.del ay( intTicks) 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.delay( intTicks ); 

Description 

Movie method; pauses the playhead for a given amount of time. 


284 Chapter 12: Methods 




The only mouse and keyboard activity possible during this time is stopping the movie by pressing 
Control+Alt+period (Windows) or Command+period (Macintosh). Because it increases the time 
of individual frames, del ay () is useful for controlling the playback rate of a sequence of frames. 

The delay!) method can be applied only when the playhead is moving. However, when delay!) 
is in effect, handlers still run; only the playhead halts, not script execution. Place scripts that use 
del ay () in either an enterFrame or exi tFrame handler. 

To mimic the behavior of a halt in a handler when the playhead is not moving, use the 
milliseconds property of the System object and wait for the specified amount of time to pass 
before exiting the frame. 

Parameters 

i ntTi cks Required. An integer that specifies the number of ticks to pause the playhead. Each 
tick is 1/60 of a second. 

Example 

This handler delays the movie for 2 seconds when the playhead exits the current frame: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on keyDown 

_movie.del ay(2*60) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function keyDown!) { 

_movie.del ay(2*60); 

1 


This handler, which can be placed in a frame script, delays the movie a random number of ticks: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on keyDown 

if (_key.key = "x") then 
_movie.delay(random(180)) 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function keyDown!) { 
if (_key.key == "x") { 

_movie.delay(random(180)); 

)

delete() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
f 7 leioObjRef. del ete() 

// JavaScript syntax 
f 7 leioObjRef. del ete(); 

Description 

Fileio method; Deletes a file. 

Parameters 

None.

deleteAt 

Usage 

1ist.del eteAtinumber) 
deleteAt list, number 

Description 

List command; deletes an from a linear or property list. 

The del eteAt command checks whether an item is in a list; if you try to delete an object that 
isn’t in the list, Director displays an alert. 

Parameters 

number Required. Specifies the position of the item in the list to delete. 

Example 

This statement deletes the second item from the list named designers, which contains [gee, 
kayne, ohashi]: 

designers = ["gee", "kayne", "ohashi"] 
designers.deleteAt(2) 

The result is the list [gee, ohashi]. 

This handler checks whether an object is in a list before attempting to delete it: 

on myDeleteAt theList, thelndex 
if theList.count < thelndex then 
beep 
el se 

theList.deleteAt(the Index) 
end i f

dot() 

Usage 

vectorl ,dot( vector2 ) 

Description 

3D vector method; returns the sum of the products of the x, y, and z components of two vectors. 
If both vectors are normalized, the dot is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. 

To manually arrive at the dot of two vectors, multiply the x component of vectorl by the x 
component of vector2, then multiply the y component of vectorl by the y component of 
v e c t o r 2 , then multiply the z component of vectorl by the z component ofvector2, and finally 
add the three products together. 

This method is identical to dotProductl ) function. 

Parameters 

vector2 Required. The second vector from which a sum is returned. 

Example 

In this example, the angle between the vectors pos5 and pos6 is 45 degrees. The getNormal 1 zed 
function returns the normalized values of pos5 and pos6, and stores them in the variables norml 
and norm2. The dot of norml and norm2 is 0.7071, which is the cosine of 45 degrees. 

pos5 = vector(100, 100, 0) 
pos6 = vectorlO, 100, 0) 
put pos5.angleBetween(pos6) 

-- 45.0000 

norml = pos5.getNormalized() 
put norml 

-- vectorl 0.7071, 0.7071, 0.0000 ) 
norm2 = pos6.getNormalized()

dotProduct() 

Usage 

vectorl .dotProduct( vector2 ) 

Description 

3D vector method; returns the sum of the products of the x, y, and z components of two vectors. 
If both vectors are normalized, the dotproduct is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. 

To manually arrive at the dot of two vectors, multiply the x component of vectorl by the x 
component of vector2, then multiply the y component of vectorl by the y component of 
v e c t o r 2 , then multiply the z component of vectorl by the z component ofvector2, and finally 
add the three products together. 

This method is identical to dot( ) function. 

Parameters 

vector2 Required. The second vector from which a sum is returned. 

Example 

In this example, the angle between the vectors pos5 and pos6 is 45°. The getNormal i zed 
function returns the normalized values of pos5 and pos6, and stores them in the variables norml 
and norm2. The dotProduct of norml and norm2 is 0.7071, which is the cosine of 45°. 

pos5 = vector(100, 100, 0)

Director movies in authoring mode and projectors support the downLoadNetThi ng command, 
but the Shockwave Player does not. This protects users from unintentionally copying files from 
the Internet. 


296 Chapter 12: Methods 



Although many network operations can be active at one time, running more than four concurrent 
operations usually slows down performance unacceptably. 

Neither the Director movies cache size nor the setting for the Check Documents option affects 
the behavior of the downl oadNetThi ng command. 

Parameters 

URL Required. The URL of any object that can be downloaded: for example, an FTP or HTTP 
server, an HTML page, an external cast member, a Director movie, or a graphic. 

I ocal Fi 1 e Required. The pathname and filename for the file on the local disk. 

Example 

These statements download an external cast member from a URL to the Director application 
folder and then make that file the external cast member named Cast of Thousands: 

downLoadNetThing("http://www.cbDeMi11e.com/Thousands.cst", the \ 
applicationPath&"Thousands.Cst") 

castLib("Cast of Thousands").fi1eName = the applicationPath&"Thousands.Cst”

Usage 

( oldList) . dupl i cate() 
duplicate( oldList ) 

Description 

List function; returns a copy of a list and copies nested lists (list items that also are lists) and their 
contents. The function is useful for saving a list’s current content. 

When you assign a list to a variable, the variable contains a reference to the list, not the list itself. 
This means any changes to the copy also affect the original list. 

To see an example of d u p 1 i c a t e () (list f u n c t i o n ) used in a completed movie, see the Vector 
Shapes movie in the Learning/Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters

errorQ 303 



externalEvent() 

Usage 

external Event "string" 

Description 

Command; sends a string to the browser that the browser can interpret as a scripting language 
instruction, allowing a movie playing or a browser to communicate with the HTML page in 
which it is embedded. 

This command works only for movies in browsers. 

Note: The external Event command does not produce a return value. There is no immediate way to 
determine whether the browser handled the event or ignored it. Use on Eval Seri pt within the 
browser to return a message to the movie. 

Parameters 

string Required. The string to send to the browser. This string must be in a scripting language 
supported by the browser. 

Example 

The following statements use external Event in the LiveConnect scripting environment, which 
is supported by Netscape 3.x and later. 

LiveConnect evaluates the string passed by external Event as a function call. JavaScript authors 
must define and name this function in the HTML header. In the movie, the function name and 
parameters are defined as a string in external Event. Because the parameters must be interpreted 
by the browser as separate strings, each parameter is surrounded by single quotation marks. 

Statements within HTML: 

function MyFunction(parml, parm2) { 

//script here 

1 

Statements within a script in the movie: 

external Event ("MyFunction('parml'parm2')") 

The following statements use external Event in the ActiveX scripting environment used by 
Internet Explorer in Windows. ActiveX treats external Event as an event and processes this 
event and its string parameter the same as an onCl i ck event in a button object. 

• Statements within HTML: 

In the HTML header, define a function to catch the event; this example is in VBScript: 

Sub 

NameOfShockwave I nstance_externalEvent!aParam) 

'script here 
End Sub 


304 Chapter 12: Methods 



Alternatively, define a script for the event: 

<SCRIPT F0R="Name0fShockwave Instance" 

EVENT="externalEvent(aParam)" 

LANGUAGE="VBScript"> 

'script here 
</S C RIPT> 

Within the movie, include the function and any parameters as part of the string for 
external Event: 

external Event ("MyFunction ('parml','parm2')")

extrude3D 

Usage 

member! whichTextCastmember) .extrude3D(member( which3dCastmember)) 

Description 

3D command; creates a new #extruder model resource in a 3D cast member from the text in a 
text cast member. 

This is not the same as using the 3D di spl ayMode property of a text cast member. 

To create a model using extrude3D: 

1 Create a new #extruder model resource in a 3D cast member: 

textResource = member!" textMember" ).extrude3D(member\ 

( "3DMember ")) 

2 Create a new model using the model resource created in step 1: 

member! "3DMember" ).newModel("myText", textResource) 

Parameters 

whi ch3dCastmember Required. The cast member within which a new #extruder model resource 
is created. 

Example 

In this example, Logo is a text cast member and Scene is a 3D cast member. The first line creates 
a model resource in Scene which is a 3D version of the text in Logo. The second line uses this 
model resource to create a model named 3dLogo. 

myTextModel Resource = member!"Logo").extrude3d(member!"Scene”)) 
member!"Scene").newModel("3dLogo", myTextModel Resource)

findl_abel() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef. f i ndLabel ( whichLabelName) 

II JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. f i ndLabel ( whi chLabel Name); 

Description 

Function: this function returns the frame number (within the Flash movie) that is associated with 
the label name requested. 

A 0 is returned if the label doesn’t exist, or if that portion of the Flash movie has not yet been 
streamed in. 

Parameters 

whi chLabel Name Required. Specifies the frame label to find. 

findEmptyO 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

castObjRef. f i ndEmpty ({memberObjRef 1) 

// JavaScript syntax 

castObjRef. findEmpty ({memberObjRef 1); 

Description 

Cast library method; displays the next empty cast member position or the position after a 
specified cast member. 

This method is available only on the current cast library. 

Parameters 

memberObjRef Optional. A reference to the cast member after which the next empty cast member 
position is displayed. If omitted, the next empty cast member position is displayed. 


findEmptyO 313 



Example 

This statement finds the first empty cast member on or after cast member 100: 

-- Lingo syntax 

trace(castLib(l).findEmpty(member(100))) 

// JavaScript syntax 

trace!castLib(l).findEmpty(member(100 )));

Cast Library, Member 

findPos 

Usage 

7 7st.fi ndPos( property ) 
findPos!7/st, property ) 

Description 

List command; identifies the position of a property in a property list. 

Using f i ndPos with linear lists returns a bogus number if the value of property is a number and 
a script error if the value of property is a string. 

The findPos command performs the same function as the findPosNear command, except that 
findPos is VOID when the specified property is not in the list. 

Parameters 

property Required. The property whose position is identified. 

Example 

This statement identifies the position of the property c in the list Answers, which consists of 
[#a:10, #b: 12, #c: 15, #d:22]: 

Answers.findPos(#c) 

The result is 3, because c is the third property in the list. 

See also 

findPosNear, sort 

findPosNear 

Usage 

sortedList. fi ndPos Near ( va1ueOrProperty) 
f i ndPosNear( sortedL1st, va1ueOrProperty) 

Description 

List command; for sorted lists only, identifies the position of an item in a specified sorted list. 

The fi ndPosNear command works only with sorted lists. Replace va 1 ueOrProperty with a 
value for sorted linear lists, and with a property for sorted property lists. 


314 Chapter 12: Methods 



The fi ndPosNear command is similar to the f i ndPos command, except that when the specified 
property is not in the list, the fi ndPosNear command identifies the position of the value with the 
most similar alphanumeric name. This command is useful in finding the name that is the closest 
match in a sorted directory of names. 

Parameters 

i /a 1 ueOrProperty Required. The value or property whose position is identified. 

Example 

This statement identifies the position of a property in the sorted list Answers, which consists of 
[#Nile:2, #Pharaoh:4, #Raja:0]: 

Answers.findPosNear(#Ni) 

The result is 1, because Ni most closely matches Nile, the first property in the list.

finishldleLoad() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movi e. f i ni shldl eLoad( ntLoadTag) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movi e. fi ni shldl eLoad( intLoadTag); 

Description 

Movie method; forces completion of loading for all the cast members that have the specified 
load tag. 

Parameters 

7 ntLoadTag Required. An integer that specifies the load tag of the cast members to be loaded. 

Example 

This statement completes the loading of all cast members that have the load tag 20: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.finishldleLoad(20) 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.finishIdleLoad(20);

flashToStage() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef. f1 ashToStage (pointin FIashMovie) 

// JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. fl as hToSt a ge( point InFl dshMo vie ); 

Description 

Function; returns the coordinate on the Director Stage that corresponds to a specified coordinate 
in a Flash movie sprite. The function accepts both the Flash channel and movie coordinate and 
returns the Director Stage coordinate as Director point values: for example, point(300,300). 

Flash movie coordinates are measured in Flash movie pixels, which are determined by a movies 
original size when it was created in Flash. For the purpose of calculating Flash movie coordinates, 
point(0,0) of a Flash movie is always at its upper left corner. (The cast member’s ori gi nPoi nt 
property is used only for rotation and scaling, not to calculate movie coordinates.) 

The fl ashToStage and the corresponding stageToFl ash functions are helpful for determining 
which Flash movie coordinate is directly over a Director Stage coordinate. For both Flash and 
Director, point(0,0) is the upper left corner of the Flash Stage or Director Stage. These 
coordinates may not match on the Director Stage if a Flash sprite is stretched, scaled, or rotated. 

Parameters 

pointlnFlashMovie Required. The point in the Flash movie sprite whose coordinates 
are returned. 

Example 

This handler accepts a point value and a sprite reference as a parameter, and it then sets the 
upper left coordinate of the specified sprite to the specified point within a Flash movie sprite in 
channel 10: 

-- Lingo syntax 

on snapSprite(whichFlashPoint, whichSprite) 

sprite(whichSprite).1oc = sprited).FlashToStage(whichFlashPoint) 

_movi e.updatestageO 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function snapSprite(whichFlashPoint, whichSprite) { 

sprite(whichSprite).1oc = sprited).FlashToStage(whichFlashPoint); 

_movi e.updateStaged;

forget() (Window) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
windowObjRef. forget() 

// JavaScript syntax 
windowObjRef. forget (); 

Description 

Window method; instructs script to close a window and stop its playback when it’s no longer in 
use and no other variables refer to it. 

Calling forget!) on a window also removes that window’s reference from the windowList. 

When the forget ( ) method is called, the window and the movie in a window (MIAW) disappear 
without calling the stopMovi e, cl oseWi ndow, or deacti vateWi ndow handlers. 

If there are many global references to the movie in a window, the window doesn’t respond to the 
forget! ) method. 

Parameters 

None.

framesToHMS() 

Usage 

framesToHMSl frames, tempo, dropFrame, fractionalSeconds) 

Description 

Function; converts the specified number of frames to their equivalent length in hours, minutes, 
and seconds. This function is useful for predicting the actual playtime of a movie or controlling a 
video playback device. 

The resulting string uses the form sHH : MM : SS. FFD, where: 

s A character is used if the time is less than zero, or a space if the time is greater than or equal 

to zero. 

HH Hours. 

MM Minutes. 

SS Seconds. 

FF Indicates a fraction of a second if fractional Seconds is TRUE or frames if fractional Seconds 
is FALSE. 

D A "d" is used if dropFrame is TRUE, oraspace if dropFrame is FALSE. 


Parameters 

frames Required. An integer expression that specifies the number of frames. 

tempo Required. An integer expression that specifies the tempo in frames per second. 

dropFrame Required. Compensates for the color NTSC frame rate, which is not exactly 30 
frames per second and is meaningful only if FPS is set to 30 frames per second. Normally, this 
parameter is set to FALSE. 

fractiona 1 Seconds Required. Determines whether the residual frames are converted to the 
nearest hundredth of a second (TRUE) or returned as an integer number of frames (FALSE). 

Example 

The following statement converts a 2710-frame, 30 frame-per-second movie. The dropFrame and 
fractiona 1 Seconds arguments are both turned off:

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.frameReady ({/ ntFrameNum] ); 

_movie.frameReady ( frameNumA, frameNumB ) ; 

Description 

Movie method; for Director movies, projectors, and movies with Shockwave content, determines 
whether the cast members of a frame or range of frames have been downloaded. 

This method returns TRUE if the specified cast members have been downloaded, and FALSE if not. 

For a demonstration of the f rameReady () method used in a Director movie, see the sample 
movie “Streaming Shockwave” in Director Help. 

Parameters 

7 ntFrameNum Optional if testing whether a single frame’s cast members have been downloaded. 
An integer that specifies the individual frame to test. If omitted, f rameReady () determines 
whether the cast members used in any frame of a Score have been downloaded. 

frameNumA Required if testing whether the cast members in a range of frames have been 
downloaded. An integer that specifies the first frame in the range. 

frameNumB Required if testing whether the cast members in a range of frames have been 
downloaded. An integer that specifies the last frame in the range. 

Example 

This statement determines whether the cast members for frame 20 are downloaded and ready to 
be viewed: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame 

if (_movie.frameReady(20)) then 
_movie.go(20) 
el se 

_movie.go(1)

freeBlock() 

Usage 

the freeBlock 

Description 

Function; indicates the size of the largest free contiguous block of memory, in bytes. A kilobyte 
(K) is 1024 bytes. A megabyte (MB) is 1024 kilobytes. Loading a cast member requires a free 
block at least as large as the cast member. 

Parameters 

None. 


322 Chapter 12: Methods 



Example 

This statement determines whether the largest contiguous free block is smaller than 10K and 
displays an alert if it is: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (the freeBlock < (10 * 1024)) then alert "Not enough memory!" 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (freeBlock < (10 * 1024)) { 
alertC'Not enough memory!")

freeBytesO, memorySize, ramNeededO, size 

freeBytes() 

Usage 

the freeBytes 

Description 

Function; indicates the total number of bytes of free memory, which may not be contiguous. A 
kilobyte (K) is 1024 bytes. A megabyte (MB) is 1024 kilobytes. 

This function differs from f reeBl ock in that it reports all free memory, not just 
contiguous memory. 

On the Macintosh, selecting Use System Temporary Memory in the Director General Preferences 
or in a projector’s Options dialog box tells the freeBytes function to return all the free memory 
that is available to the application. This amount equals the application’s allocation shown in its 
Get Info dialog box and the Largest Unused Block value in the About This Macintosh dialog box. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement checks whether more than 200K of memory is available and plays a color movie 
if it is: 

if (the freeBytes > (200 * 1024)) then play movie "colorMovie"

generateNormals() 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource( whichModelResource). 
generateNormal s( style) 

Description 

3D #mesh model resource command; calculates the normal vectors for each vertex of the mesh. 

If the styl e parameter is set to #fl at, each vertex receives a normal for each face to which it 
belongs. Furthermore, all three of the vertices of a face will have the same normal. For example, if 
the vertices of fa ce[1] all receive normal [ 1 ] and the vertices of f a ce [ 2 ] all receive normal [ 2 ], 
and the two faces share vertex[8], then the normal of vertex[8] is normal [1] in face[l] and 
normal [2] in face[2]. Use of the #fl at parameter results in very clear delineation of the 
faces of the mesh. 

If the style parameter is set to ^smooth, each vertex receives only one normal, regardless of the 
number of faces to which it belongs, and the three vertices of a face can have different normals. 
Each vertex normal is the average of the face normals of all of the faces that share the vertex. Use 
of the #smooth parameter results in a more rounded appearance of the faces of the mesh, except at 
the outer edges of the faces at the silhouette of the mesh, which are still sharp. 

A vertex normal is a direction vector which indicates the “forward” direction of a vertex. If the 
vertex normal points toward the camera, the colors displayed in the area of the mesh controlled by 
that normal are determined by the shader. If the vertex normal points away from the camera, the 
area of the mesh controlled by that normal will be non-visible. 

After using the genera teNormal s () command, you must use the bui 1 d () command to rebuild 
the mesh. 

Parameters 

style Required. A symbol that specifies the style of the vertex. 

Example 

The following statement calculates vertex normals for the model resource named FloorMesh. The 
style parameter is set to #smooth, so each vertex in the mesh will receive only one normal.

getaProp 

Usage 

property List.propertyName 
getaProp( 1 ist, itern) 

1 istl 1 / stPosi ti on] 
propertyList [ #propertyName ] 
propertyList [ "propertyName" ] 

Description 

List command; for linear and property lists, identifies the value associated with the item specified 
by item, 1 i stPosi t i on, or propertyName in the list specified by list. 

• When the list is a linear list, replace ; tern with the number for an item’s position in a list as 
shown by 1 istPos i t ion. The result is the value at that position. 

• When the list is a property list, replace i tern with a property in the list as in propertyName. 
The result is the value associated with the property. 

The getaProp command returns VOID when the specified value is not in the list. 

When used with linear lists, the getaProp command has the same function as the 
getAt command. 

Parameters 

7 temNameOrNum Required. For linear lists, an integer that specifies the index position of the value 
in the list to return; for property lists, a symbol (Lingo) or a string (JavaScript syntax) that 
specifies the property whose value is returned. 

Example 

This statement identifies the value associated with the property #joe in the property list ages, 
which consists of [#john:10, #joe:12, #cheryl:15, #barbara:22]: 

put getaProplages, #joe) 

The result is 12, because this is the value associated with the property #joe. 

The same result can be achieved using bracket access on the same list: 
put ages[#joe] 

The result is again 12. 

If you want the value at a certain position in the list, you can also use bracket access. To get the 
third value in the list, associated with the third property, use this syntax: 

put ages[3] 

-- 15 

Note: Unlike the getAProp command where VOID is returned when a property doesn’t exist, a script 
error will occur if the property doesn't exist when using bracket access. 

See also 

getAt, getOneO, getPropO, setaProp, setAt 


getaProp 325 




get At 

Usage 

getAt(7/st, position ) 
list LpositionH 

Description 

List command; identifies the item in a specified position of a specified list. If the list contains 
fewer elements than the specified position, a script error occurs. 

The get At command works with linear and property lists. This command has the same function 
as the getaProp command for linear lists. 

This command is useful for extracting a list from within another list, such as the 
deskTopRectList. 

Parameters 

list Required. Specifies the list from in which the item exists. 
position Required. Specifies the index position of the item in the list. 

Example 

This statement causes the Message window to display the third item in the answers list, which 
consists of [10, 12, 15, 22]: 

put getAt(answers, 3) 

-- 15 

The same result can be returned using bracket access: 

put answers[3] 

-- 15 

The following example extracts the first entry in a list containing two entries that specify name, 
department, and employee number information. Then the second element of the newly extracted 
list is returned, identifying the department in which the first person in the list is employed. The 
format of the list is [[“Dennis”, “consulting”, 510], [“Sherry”, “Distribution”, 973]], and the list is 
called employeelnfoList. 

firstPerson = getAtlemployeelnfoList, 1) 
put firstPerson 

-- ["Dennis", "consulting", 510] 
firstPersonDept = getAt(firstPerson, 2) 
put firstPersonDept 
-- "consulting" 

It’s also possible to nest get At commands without assigning values to variables in intermediate 
steps. This format can be more difficult to read and write, but less verbose. 

firstPersonDept = getAt(getAtlemployeelnfoList, 1), 2) 
put firstPersonDept 
-- "consulting" 


326 Chapter 12: Methods 



You can also use the bracket list access: 


firstPerson = employeelnfoList[1] 
put firstPerson 

-- ["Dennis", "consulting", 510] 
firstPersonDept = firstPerson[2] 
put firstPersonDept 
-- "consulting" 

As with getAt, brackets can be nested: 
firstPersonDept = employeelnfoList[l][2]

getError() (Flash, SWA) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. getError() 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. getError(); 

Description 

Function; for Shockwave Audio (SWA) or Flash cast members, indicates whether an error 
occurred as the cast member streamed into memory and returns a value. 

Shockwave Audio cast members have the following possible getError! ) integer values and 
corresponding getErrorStri ng( ) messages: 


getError() value 

getErrorString() message 

0 

OK 

1 

memory 

2 

network 

3

Flash movie cast members have the following possible getError values: 

• FALSE —No error occurred. 

• ((memory —There is not enough memory to load the cast member. 

• #f i 1 eNotFound —The file containing the cast members assets could not be found. 

• ((network —A network error prevented the cast member from loading. 

• #f i 1 e Format —The file was found, but it appears to be of the wrong type, or an error occurred 
while reading the file. 

• #o t h e r —Some other error occurred. 

When an error occurs as a cast member streams into memory, Director sets the cast member’s 
state property to -1. Use the getError function to determine what type of error occurred. 


getErrorQ (Flash, SWA) 327 







Parameters 


None. 

Example 

This handler uses getError to determine whether an error involving the Shockwave Audio cast 
member Norma Desmond Speaks occurred and displays the appropriate error string in a field if 
it did: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame 

if member!"Norma Desmond Speaks") .getError!) <> 0 then

The following handler checks to see whether an error occurred for a Flash cast member named 
Dali, which was streaming into memory. If an error occurred, and it was a memory error, the 
script uses the unloadCast command to try to free some memory; it then branches the playhead 
to a frame in the Director movie named Artists, where the Flash movie sprite first appears, so 
Director can again try to load and play the Flash movie. If something other than an out-of- 
memory error occurred, the script goes to a frame named Sorry, which explains that the requested 
Flash movie can’t be played. 

-- Lingo syntax

getFlashProperty() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef. getFl ashProperty( targetName, symProp) 

II JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. getFl ashProperty ( targetName, symProp); 

Description 

This function allows Lingo to invoke the Flash action script function getPropertyO on the 
given Flash sprite. This Flash action script function is used to get the value of properties of movie 
clips or levels within a Flash movie. This is similar to testing sprite properties within Director. 

To get a global property of the Flash sprite, pass an empty string as the targetName. These global 
Flash properties can be tested: #focusRect and #spri teSoundBuf ferTi me. 

See the Flash documentation for descriptions of these properties. 

Parameters 

targetName Required. A string that specifies the name of the movie clip or level whose property 
you want to get within the given Flash sprite. 

s ymProp Required. A symbol that specifies the name of the property to get. Valid values include: 
#posX, #posY, #seal eX, #scal eY, #vi si bl e, #rotate, #al pha, #name, #width, #hei ght, 
#target, #url, #dropTarget, #total Frames, #currentFrame, #cursor, and 
#1 astf rameLoaded. 

Example 

This statement gets the value of the #rotate property of the movie clip Star in the Flash member 
in sprite 3: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(3).set FIashProperty("Star", #rotate) 
sprite(3).getFlashProperty() 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(3).set FIashProperty("Star", symbol("rotate")); 
sprite(3).getFlashProperty(); 


getFlashPropertyQ 331 



getFrameLabel() 

Usage 

sprite( whichFlashSprite). getFrameLabel ( whichFlashFrameNumber) 
get Frame La be!(sprite whichFlashSprite, whichFlashFrameNumber) 

Description 

Function; returns the frame label within a Flash movie that is associated with the frame number 
requested. If the label doesn’t exist, or that portion of the Flash movie has not yet been streamed 
in, this function returns an empty string. 

Parameters 

whi chFl ashFrameNumber Required. Specifies the frame number that is associated with the 
frame label. 

Example 

The following handler looks to see if the marker on frame 15 of the Flash movie playing in sprite 
1 is called "Lions". If it is, the Director movie navigates to frame "Lions". If it isn’t, the Director 
movie stays in the current frame and the Flash movie continues to play. 

-- Lingo syntax

getLatestNetID 

Usage 

getLatestNetID 

Description 

This function returns an identifier for the last network operation that started. 

The identifier returned by getLatestNetID can be used as a parameter in the net Done , 
netError , and netAbort functions to identify the last network operation. 

Note: This function is included for backward compatibility. It is recommended that you use the 
network ID returned from a net lingo function rather than getLatestNetID. However, if you use 
getLatestNetID, use it immediately after issuing the netLingo command. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This script assigns the network ID of a getNetText operation to the field cast member Result so 
results of that operation can be accessed later: 

on startOperation 
global gNetID 
getNetTextf"url") 
set gNetID = getLatestNetIDf) 
end 

on checkOperation 
global gNetID 
if netDone(gNetlD) then

getl_ength() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

fi 1 eioObjRef. get Length () 

// JavaScript syntax 
fi leioObjRef. get Length (); 

Description 

Fileio method; Returns the length of an open file. 

You must first open a file by calling openFi 1 e( ) before using getLength( ) to return the length 
of the file. 

Parameters 

None. 

See also 

Fileio. openFileO 

getNetText() 

Usage 

getNetText (URL {, serverOSString] (, characterSet )) 
getNetText(URL, propertyList {, serverOSString) {, characterSet}) 

Description 

Function; starts the retrieval of text from a file usually on an F1TTP or FTP server, or initiates a 
CGI query. 

The first syntax shown starts the text retrieval. You can submit FITTP CGI queries this way and 
must properly encode them in the URL. The second syntax includes a property list and submits a 
CGI query, providing the proper URL encoding. 

Use the optional parameter propertyList to take a property list for CGI queries. The property 
list is URL encoded and the URL sent is ( url stri ng & "1" & encodedpropl i st). 

Use the optional parameter serverOSStri ng to encode any return characters in property1 ist. 
The value defaults to UNIX but may be set to W i n or M a c and translates any carriage returns in the 
property 1 ist argument into those used on the server. For most applications, this setting is 
unnecessary because line breaks are usually not used in form responses. 

The optional parameter characterSet applies only if the user is running Director on a 
shi ft-JIS (Japanese) system. Possible character set settings are JIS, EUC, ASCI I, and AUTO. 
Lingo converts the retrieved data from shi ft -JIS to the named character set. Using the AUTO 
setting, character set tries to determine what character set the retrieved text is in and translate it to 
the character set on the local machine. The default setting is ASCII. 

Use netDone to find out when the getNetText operation is complete, and netError to find out 
if the operation was successful. Use netTextResul t to return the text retrieved by getNetText. 

The function works with relative URLs. 


getNetTextQ 335 



To see an example of getNetText () used in a completed movie, see the Forms and Post movie in 
the Learning/Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters 

URL Required. The URL to the file that contains the text to get. 
propertyList Optional. Specifies a property list used for CGI queries. 
serverOSStri ng Optional. Specifies the encoding of return characters in property L ist. 
characterSet Optional. Specifies character settings. 

Example 

This script retrieves text from the URL http://BigServer.com/sample.txt and updates the field cast 
member the mouse pointer is on when the mouse button is clicked: 

property spriteNum 
property theNetID 

on mouseUp me 

theNetID = getNetText ("http://BigServer.com/sample.txt") 
end 

on exitFrame me 

if netDone(theNetlD) then 

sprite(spriteNum).member.text = netTextResult(theNetlD) 
end i f 
end 

This example retrieves the results of a CGI query: 

getNetText("http://www.yourserver.com/cgi-bin/query.cgi?name=Bi11") 

This is the same as the previous example, but it uses a property list to submit a CGI query, and 
does the URL encoding for you: 

getNetText("http://www.yourserver.com/cgi-bin/query.cgi", [#name:"Bill"])

getNormalized 

Usage 

getNormalized( vector ) 
vector. getNormal i zed() 

Description 

3D vector method; copies the vector and divides the x, y, and z components of the copy by the 
length of the original vector. The resulting vector has a length of 1 world unit. 

This method returns the copy and leaves the original vector unchanged. To normalize the original 
vector, use the normal i ze command. 


336 Chapter 12: Methods 



Example 

The following statement stores the normalized value of the vector MyVec in the variable Norm. 
The value of Norm is vector (-0.1199, 0.9928, 0.0000) and the magnitude of Norm is 1. 

MyVec = vector!-209.9019, 1737.5126, 0.0000) 

Norm = MyVec.getNormalized() 
put Norm 

-- vector! -0.1199, 0.9928, 0.0000 ) 
put Norm.magnitude 
-- 1.0000

getNthFileNamelnFolder() 

Usage 

getNthFileNamelnFolder! folderPath , fi1eNumber) 

Description 

Movie method; returns a filename from the directory folder based on the specified path and 
number within the folder. To be found by the getNthFileNamelnFolder function, Director 
movies must be set to visible in the folder structure. (On the Macintosh, other types of files are 
found whether they are visible or invisible.) If this function returns an empty string, you have 
specified a number greater than the number of files in the folder. 

The getNthFi 1 eNamelnFol der function doesn’t work with URLs. 

To specify other folder names, use the @ pathname operator or the full path defined in the format 
for the specific platform on which the movie is running. For example: 

• In Windows, use a directory path such as C:/Director/Movies. 

• On the Macintosh, use a pathname such as HardDisk:Director:Movies. To look for files on the 
Macintosh desktop, use the path HardDisk:Desktop Folder 

• This function is not available in Shockwave Player. 

Parameters 

fol derPath Required. Specifies the path to the folder that contains the file. 
fi 1 eNumber Required. Specifies the index position of the file in the folder. 

Example 

The following handler returns a list of filenames in the folder on the current path. To call the 
function, use parentheses, as in put currentFolder!). 

on currentFolder 
fi 1 eLi st = [ ] 
repeat with i = 1 to 100 

n = getNthFi1eNamelnFol der(the moviePath, i) 
if n = EMPTY then exit repeat 
fi1eList.append!n) 
end repeat 
return fileList 
end currentFolder

getNthFileNamelnFolderQ 337 



getOne() 

Usage 

list.getOne( va1ue) 
getOne( list, va1ue) 

Description 

List function; identifies the position (linear list) or property (property list) associated with a value 
in a list. 

For values contained in the list more than once, only the first occurrence is displayed. The 
getOne command returns the result 0 when the specified value is not in the list. 

When used with linear lists, the getOne command performs the same functions as the 
getPos command. 

Parameters 

va 1 ue Required. Specifies the value associated with the position or property. 

Example 

This statement identifies the position of the value 12 in the linear list Answers, which consists of 
[10, 12, 15, 22]: 

put Answers.getOne!12) 

The result is 2, because 12 is the second value in the list. 

This statement identifies the property associated with the value 12 in the property list Answers, 
which consists of [#a:10, #b: 12, #c:15, #d:22]: 

put Answers.getOne!12) 

The result is #b, which is the property associated with the value 12.

getPixel() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

iwageObjRef.getPTx.eMx, y {, # integer }) 
imageObjRef. getPixel (point(x, y) {, # integer }) 

// JavaScript syntax 

imageObjRef. getPixel (x, y {, # integer }); 
imageObjRef. getPi xel (point(x, y) {, # integer (); 

Description 

Image method. Returns an indexed or RGB color of the pixel at a specified point in a given 
image. 

The index of the rows and columns of the returned image starts with 0. Therefore, in order to 
access the top left pixel of an image, specify the location as (0,0), and not (1,1). If a given image 
is h pixels high and w pixels wide, to access the bottom right pixel of the image, specify the 
location as (iv, 1), (h,l). 

This method returns a value of 0 if the specified pixel is outside the given image. 

To set a lot of pixels to the color of another pixel, it is faster to set them as raw numbers (by using 
the optional #i nteger parameter). Raw integer color values are also useful because they contain 
alpha layer information as well as color when the image is 32-bit. The alpha channel information 
can be extracted from the raw integer by dividing the integer by 2 A 8+8+8. 

Parameters 

x Required if specifying a pixel using x and y coordinates. An integer that specifies the x 
coordinate of the pixel. 

y Required if specifying a pixel using x and y coordinates. An integer that specifies the y 
coordinate of the pixel. 

# integer Optional. A symbol that specifies the raw number of the returned color value. 

poi nt (x, y) Required if specifying a pixel using a point. A point that specifies the point of 
the pixel. 

Example 

These statements get the color of the pixel at point (90, 20) in member Happy and set sprite 2 to 
that color: 

This statement sets the variable alpha to the alpha channel value of the point (25, 33) in the 
32-bit image object mylmage:

getStreamStatus() 

Usage 

getStreamStatus (net ID) 
getStreamStatus( URLString) 

Description 

Function; returns a property list matching the format used for the globally available 
tel 1 StreamStatus function that can be used with callbacks to sprites or objects. The list 
contains the following strings: 


#URL String containing the URL location used to start the network operation. 

fstate String consisting of Connecting, Started, InProgress, Complete, “Error”, or 

“Noinformation” (this last string is for the condition when either the net ID is so old 
that the status information has been dropped or the URL specified in URLStri rg 
was not found in the cache). 


fbytesSoFar Number of bytes retrieved from the network so far. 

fbytesTotal Total number of bytes in the stream, if known. The value may be 0 if the HTTP 
server does not include the content length in the MIME header. 


terror String containing ““ (EMPTY) if the download is not complete, OK if it completed 

successfully, or an error code if the download ended with an error. 


For example, you can start a network operation with get Net Text () and track its progress with 
getStreamStatus(). 


Parameters 

net ID Required. A network operation that represents the stream of text to operate on. 


getStreamStatusQ 345 








Example 


This statement displays in the message window the current status of a download begun with 
getNetTextl) and the resulting net ID placed in the variable net ID: 

put getStreamStatus(netlD) 

-- [#URL: "www.macromedia.com", #state: "InProgress", #bytesSoFar: 250, \ 

#bytesTotal: 50000, #error: EMPTY]

getVariable() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri teObjRef. getVari a bl e( variableName { , returnVa 1 ueOrReference )) 

// JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. getVari abl e( vari abl eName { , returnVa 1 ueOrReference] ); 

Description 

Function; returns the current value of the given variable from the specified Flash sprite. Flash 
variables were introduced in Flash version 4. 

This function can be used in two ways. 

Setting the optional returnVa 1 ueOrReference parameter to TRUE (the default) returns the 
current value of the variable as a string. Setting the return Va 1 ueOrReference parameter to 
FALSE returns the current literal value of the Flash variable. 

If the value of the Flash variable is an object reference, you must set the 

return Va 1 ueOrReference parameter to FALSE in order for the returned value to have meaning 
as an object reference. If it is returned as a string, the string will not be a valid object reference. 

Parameters 

vari abl eName Required. Specifies the name of the variable whose value is returned. 

returnVal ueOrReference Optional. Specifies whether the returned value is a string (TRUE) or as 
an object reference (FALSE). 

Example 

This statement sets the variable t V a I u e to the string value of the Flash variable named gOtherVar 
in the Flash movie in sprite 3: 

-- Lingo syntax 

tValue = sprite(3).getVariable("gOtherVar", TRUE) 
put(tValue) -- "5" 

// JavaScript syntax 

var tValue = sprite(3).getVariable("gOtherVar", true); 
tracettValue); // 5 


346 Chapter 12: Methods 



This statement sets the variable tOb ject to refer to the same object that the variable named gVa r 
refers to in the Flash movie in sprite 3: 

-- Lingo syntax 

tObject = sprite(3).getVaria ble("gVar",FALSE) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var tObject = sprite(3).getVariable("gVar",0); 

This statement returns the value of the variable currentURL from the Flash cast member in sprite 
3 and displays it in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(3).getVariable("currentURL")) 

// JavaScript syntax 

trace(sprite(3).getVariable!"currentURL")):

getWorldT ransform() 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember). node( whichNode ). getWorldTransform!) 
member( whichCastmember) .node( whichNode ).getWorldTran storm().\ 
position 

member! whichCastmember) .node! whichNode) .getWorldTransform!).\ 
rotation 

member! whichCastmember) .node! whichNode) .getWorldTransform!).scale 

Description 

3D command; returns the world-relative transform of the model, group, camera, or light 
represented by node. 

The transform property of a node is calculated relative to the transform of the node’s parent, and 
is therefore parent-relative. The getWorl dTransform!) command calculates the node’s transform 
relative to the origin of the 3D world, and is therefore world-relative. 

Use memberiwhichCastmember ). node (whi ch Node ). getWorl dTransform!) .position to find 
the position property of the node’s world-relative transform. You can also use worldPositionasa 
shortcut for getWorl dTransform!). posi ti on. 

Use member! whi chCastmember ). node! whi chNode ). getWorl dTransform!) .rotation to find 
the rotation property of the node’s world-relative transform. 

Use member! whi chCastmember) .node! whi chNode ). getWorl dTransform!) .scale to find the 
scale property of the node’s world-relative transform. 

These properties can be tested but not set. 


getWorldTransformQ 347 



Example 


This statement shows the world-relative transform of the model named Box, followed by its 
position and rotation properties: 


put member("3d world").model("Box”).getworldTransform() 

-- transformd. 000000 , 0 . 000000 , 0 . 000000 , 0 . 000000 , \

go() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.go( frameNameOrNum 1, movieName )) 
// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.go( frameNameOrNum (, movieName )); 


Description 

Movie method; causes the playhead to branch to a specified frame in a specified movie. 

This method can be used to tell the playhead to loop to the previous marker, and is a convenient 
means of keeping the playhead in the same section of the movie while script remains active. 

It is best to use marker labels for frameNameOrNum instead of frame numbers; editing a movie can 
cause frame numbers to change. Using marker labels also makes it easier to read scripts. 

Calling go( ) with the movieName parameter loads frame 1 of the movie. If go( ) is called from 
within a handler, the handler in which it is placed continues executing. To suspend the handler 
while playing the movie, use the pi ay () method, which may be followed by a subsequent call to 
pi ayDone( ) to return. 

When you specify a movie to play, specify its path if the movie is in a different folder, but to 
prevent a potential load failure, don’t include the movies .dir, .dxr, or .dcr file extension. 

To more efficiently go to a movie at a URL, use the downl oadNetThi ng( ) method to download 
the movie file to a local disk first, and then use the go () method with the movieName parameter 
to go to that movie on the local disk. 

The go Loop () method sends the playhead to the previous marker in a movie, which is a 
convenient means of keeping the playhead in the same section of the movie while Lingo or 
JavaScript syntax remains active. 

The following are reset when a movie is loaded: beepOn and constra i nt properties; 
keyDownScri pt, mouseDownScri pt, and mousellpScri pt; cursor and i mmedi ate sprite 
properties; cursor( ) and puppetSpri te( ) methods; and custom menus. However, the 
ti meoutScri pt is not reset when loading a movie. 


348 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters 

frameNameOrNum Required. A string that specifies the marker label of the frame to which the 
playhead branches, or an integer that specifies the number of the frame to which the playhead 
branches. 

movi eName Optional. A string that specifies the movie that contains the frame specified by 
frameNameOrNum. This value must specify a movie file; if the movie is in another folder, 
movi eName must also specify the path. 

Example 

This statement sends the playhead to the marker named start: 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.go("start") 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.go("start"); 

This statement sends the playhead to the marker named Memory in the movie named 
Noh Tale to Tell: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.go("Memory", "Noh Tale to Tell") 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.go("Memory", "Noh Tale to Tell"): 

The following handler tells the movie to loop in the current frame. This handler is useful for 
making the movie wait in a frame while it plays so the movie can respond to events. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame 

_movie.go(_movie.frame) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFrame!) ( 

_movie.go(_movie.frame);

from the current frame if the current frame does not have a marker, or to the current frame if the 
current frame has a marker. 


gol_oop() 349 





If no markers are to the left of the playhead, the playhead branches to: 

• The next marker to the right if the current frame does not have a marker. 

• The current frame if the current frame has a marker. 

• Frame 1 if the movie contains no markers. 

Parameters 

None.

goToFrame() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef. goToFrame! frameNameOrNum) 

// JavaScript syntax 

spriteObjRef. goToFrame! frameNameOrNum ); 

Description 

Command; plays a Flash movie sprite beginning at the frame identified by the frameNumber 
parameter. You can identify the frame by either an integer indicating a frame number or by a 
string indicating a label name. Using the goToFrame command has the same effect as setting a 
Flash movie sprite’s frame property. 


goToFrame!) 351 





Example 

The following handler branches to different points within a Flash movie in channel 5. It accepts a 
parameter that indicates which frame to go to. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on Navigate(whereTo) 

sprite(5).goToFrame(whereTo) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function Navigate(whereTo) { 
sprite(5).goToFrame(whereTo); 


gotoNetMovie 

Usage 

gotoNetMovie URL 
gotoNetMovie (URL) 

Description 

Command; retrieves and plays a new movie with Shockwave content from an HTTP or FTP 
server. The current movie continues to run until the new movie is available. 

Only URLs are supported as valid parameters. The URL can specify either a filename or a marker 
within a movie. Relative URLs work if the movie is on an Internet server, but you must include 
the extension with the filename. 

When performing testing on a local disk or network, media must be located in a directory 
named dswmedia. 

If a gotoNetMovie operation is in progress and you issue a second gotoNetMovie command 
before the first is finished, the second command cancels the first. 

Parameters 

URL Required. Specifies the URL of the Shockwave content to play. 

Example 

In this statement, the URL indicates a Director filename: 
gotoNetMovie "http://www.yourserver.com/movies/moviel.dcr" 

In this statement, the URL indicates a marker within a filename: 

gotoNetMovie "http://www.yourserver.com/movies/buttons.dcr#Contents" 

In the following statement, gotoNetMovi e is used as a function. The function returns the 
network ID for the operation. 

myNetID = gotoNetMovie ("http://www.yourserver.com/movies/ 
buttons.dcr#Contents") 


352 Chapter 12: Methods 



gotoNetPage 

Usage 

gotoNetPage "URL", {" targetName ") 

Description 

Command; opens a movie with Shockwave content or another MIME file in the browser. 

Only URLs are supported as valid parameters. Relative URLs work if the movie is on an 
HTTP or FTP server. 

In the authoring environment, the gotoNetPage command launches the preferred browser if it is 
enabled. In projectors, this command tries to launch the preferred browser set with the Network 
Preferences dialog box or browserName command. If neither has been used to set the preferred 
browser, the goToNetPage command attempts to find a browser on the computer. 

Parameters 

URL Required. Specifies the URL of the movie with Shockwave content or MIME file to play. 

targetName Optional. An HTML parameter that identifies the frame or window in which the 
page is loaded. 

• If targetName is a window or frame in the browser, gotoNetPage replaces the contents of that 
window or frame. 

• If targetName isn’t a frame or window that is currently open, goToNetPage opens a 
new window. Using the string "_new" always opens a new window. 

• If targetName is omitted, gotoNetPage replaces the current page, wherever it is located. 

Example 

The following script loads the file Newpage.html into the frame or window named frwin. If a 
window or frame in the current window called frwin exists, that window or frame is used. If the 
window frwin doesn’t exist, a new window named frwin is created. 

on keyDown 

gotoNetPage "Newpage.html", "frwin" 
end 

This handler opens a new window regardless of what window the browser currently has open: 

on mouseUp 

goToNetPage "Todays_News.html", "_new" 
end

groupO 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .group!whichGroup) 
member(whichCastmember).group[ index ] 

Description 

3D element; a node in the 3D world that has a name, transform, parent, and children, but no 
other properties. 

Every 3D cast member has a default group named World that cannot be deleted. The parent 
hierarchy of all models, lights, cameras, and groups that exist in the 3D world terminates in 
group( "worl d"). 

Example 

This statement shows that the fourth group of the cast member newAlien is the group DirectOl: 

put member("newAlien").group[4] 

-- group("DirectOl")

halt() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.halt() 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.halt(); 

Description 

Movie method; exits the current handler and any handler that called it and stops the movie 
during authoring or quits the projector during runtime from a projector. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement checks whether the amount of free memory is less than 50K and, if it is, exits all 
handlers that called it and then stops the movie: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_system.freeBytes < (50*1024)) then 
_movie.halt() 
end i f

handlers() 

Usage 

scriptObject. handlerst) 

Description 

This function returns a linear list of the handlers in the given scri ptObject. Each handler name 
is presented as a symbol in the list. This function is useful for debugging movies. 

You cannot get the handlers of a script cast member directly. You have to get them via the scri pt 
property of the member. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement displays the list of handlers in the child object RedCar in the Message window: 

put RedCar.handlersO 
-- [#accelerate, #turn, #stop] 

This statement displays the list of handlers in the parent script member CarParentScript in the 
Message window:

HMStoFrames() 

Usage 

HMStoFrames(/?ms, tempo, dropFrame, fractionalSeconds) 

Description 

Function; converts movies measured in hours, minutes, and seconds to the equivalent number of 
frames or converts a number of hours, minutes, and seconds into time if you set the tempo 
argument to 1 (1 frame = 1 second). 

Parameters 

hms Required. A string expression that specifies the time in the form sHH : MM: SS. FFD, where: 


s A character is used if the time is less than zero, or a space if the time is greater than or equal 

to zero. 

HH Hours. 

MM Minutes. 

SS Seconds. 

FF Indicates a fraction of a second if fracti onal Seconds is TRUE or frames if 
fracti onal Seconds is FALSE. 

D A d is used if dropFrame is TRUE, or a space if dropFrame is FALSE. 


tempo Required. Specifies the tempo in frames per second. 


HMStoFramesQ 357 



dropFrame Required. Logical expression that determines whether the frame is a drop frame 
(TRUE) or not (FALSE). If the string hms ends in a d, the time is treated as a drop frame, regardless 
of the value of dropFrame. 

fractiona 1 Seconds Required. Logical expression that determines the meaning of the numbers 
after the seconds; they can be either fractional seconds rounded to the nearest hundredth of a 
second (TRUE) or the number of residual frames (FALSE). 

Example 

This statement determines the number of frames in a 1-minute, 30.1-second movie when the 
tempo is 30 frames per second. Neither the dropFrame nor fractiona 1 Seconds arguments 
is used. 

put HMStoFrames(" 00:01:30.10 ”, 30, FALSE, FALSE) 

-- 2710 

This statement converts 600 seconds into minutes: 

» put framesToHMS(600, 1,0,0) 

» -- " 00 : 10 : 00.00 " 

This statement converts an hour and a half into seconds:

ignoreWhiteSpace() 

Usage 

XMLparserObject. i gnoreWhi teSpacei trueOrFa1se) 

Description 

XML Command; specifies whether the parser should ignore or retain white space when 
generating a Lingo list. When i gnoreWhi teSpacei) is set to TRUE (the default), the parser 
ignores white space.When set to FALSE, the parser will retain white space and treat it as 
actual data. 

If an element has separate beginning and ending tags, such as <sampl e> </sampl e>, character 
data within the element will be ignored if, and only if, it is composed of white space only. If there 
is any non-white space, or if i gnoreWhi teSpace () is set to FALSE, there will be a CDATA node 
with the exact text, including any white space. 

Parameters 

trueOrFa 1 se Required. A value that specifies whether the parser should ignore white space 
(TRUE) or not (FALSE).

Parameters 

object Required. Specifies the object to test. 

type Optional. Specifies the type to which object is compared. If the object is of the specified 
type, the i 1 k () function returns TRUE. If the object is not of the specified type, the i 1 k () 
function returns FALSE. 


362 Chapter 12: Methods 



Example 

The following i 1 k statement identifies the type of the object named Bids: 

Bids = [: ] 
put i1k( Bids ) 

-- #proplist 

The following i 1 k statement tests whether the variable Total is a list and displays the result in the 
Message window: 

Total = 2+2 

put i1k( Total, #1ist ) 

-- 0 

In this case, since the variable Total is not a list, the Message window displays 0, which is the 
numeric equivalent of FALSE. 

The following example tests a variable named myVariable and verifies that it is a date object 
before displaying it in the Message window: 

myVariable = the systemDate 

if i1k(myVariable, #date) then put myVariable 

-- date( 1999, 2, 19 )

image() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

image! intUidth, intHeight, intBitDepth ) 

// JavaScript syntax 

image! intWidth, intHeight, intBitDepth ); 

Description 

Top level function; creates and returns a new image with specified dimensions. 

If you create a new image by using the top level image!) function, the new image is a self- 
contained set of image data, and is independent of all other images. Therefore, changes made to 
any other images have no effect on the new image. 

If you refer to an image by setting a variable equal to a source image, such as a cast member or the 
image of the Stage, the variable contains a reference to the source image. Therefore, a change 
made to the image in either the source object or the variable will be reflected in the other image. 

To avoid this behavior and create a copy of an image that is independent of the source image, use 
the duplicate!) method. The duplicate!) method returns a copy of a source image that 
inherits all the values of the source image but is not tied to the source image. Therefore, a change 
made to either the source image or the new copy of the source image will have no effect on the 
other image. 

If you create an image object by referring to a cast member, the new object contains a reference to 
the image of the member. Any changes made to the image are reflected in the cast member and in 
any sprites that are created from that member. 


364 Chapter 12: Methods 







When you create a new image object, the background color defaults to white 
(color(255,255,255)), and the alpha channel is completely opaque (color(0,0,0)). 

The alpha channel color for 100% transparency is white (color(255,255,255)); the alpha channel 
color for 100% opaque is black (color(0,0,0)). 

To see an example of i ma ge () used in a completed movie, see the Imaging movie in the Learning/ 
Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters 

intUidth Required. An integer that specifies the width of the new image. 

7 ntHei ght Required. An integer that specifies the height of the new image. 

intBi tDepth Required. An integer that specifies the bit depth of the new image. Valid values are 
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. 

Example 

The following example creates an 8-bit image that is 200 pixels wide by 200 pixels high. 

-- Lingo syntax 

objlmage = image(200, 200, 8) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objlmage = image(200, 200, 8); 

The following example creates an image by referring to the image of the Stage. 

-- Lingo syntax 

objlmage = _movie.stage. image 

// JavaScript syntax 

var objlmage = _movie.stage.image;

importFilelnto() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberObjRef. importFi 1 eInto( f i 1 eOrUrlStririg) 

// JavaScript syntax 

memberObjRef. importFi 1 eInto( fi1eOrUrlString) ; 

Description 

Member method; replaces the content of a specified cast member with a specified file. 

The importFilelntoO method is useful in the following situations. 

• When finishing or developing a movie, use it to embed external linked media so it can be 
edited during the project. 

• When generating a Score from Lingo or JavaScript syntax during movie creation, use it to 
assign content to new cast members. 


importFilelntoO 365 



• When downloading files from the Internet, use it to download the file at a specific URL and 
set the filename of linked media. 

Note: To import a file from a URL, it is usually more efficient to use the prel oadNetThi ng() to 
download the file to a local disk first, and then import the file from the local disk. Using 
prel oadNetThi ng() also minimizes any potential downloading issues. 

• Use it to import both RTF and HTML documents into text cast members with formatting and 
links intact. 

Using importFilelntoO in projectors can quickly consume available memory, so reuse the same 
members for imported data when possible. 

In Director and projectors, importFi 1 elnto() automatically downloads the file. In Shockwave 
Player, call prel oadNetThi ng() and wait for a successful completion of the download before 
using importFi 1 eInto() with the file. 

Parameters 

fi 1 eOrLIrl Stri ng Required. A string that specifies the file that will replace the content of the 
cast member. 

Example 

This handler assigns a URL that contains a GIF file to the variable tempURL and then uses the 
importFi lelnto command to import the file at the URL into a new bitmap cast member: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame 

tempURL = "http://www.dukeOfUrl.com/crown.gif" 

_movie.newMember(#bitmap).importFilelnto(tempURL) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFrameO { 

var tempURL = "http://www.dukeOfUrl.com/crown.gif"; 

_movie.newMember("bitmap").importFi1eInto(tempURL); 


This statement replaces the content of the sound cast member Memory with the sound file Wind: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("Memory").importFi1eInto("Wind.wav") 

// JavaScript syntax 

member("Memory").importFi1eInto("Wind.wav"); 

These statements download an external file from a URL to the Director application folder and 

then import that file into the sound cast member Norma Desmond Speaks: 

-- Lingo syntax 

down LoadNetThing("http://www.cbDeMille.com/Talkies.AIF", \ 

_player.applicationPath & "Talkies.AIF") 

membert"Norma Desmond Speaks").importFi1eInto(_player.applicationPath & 

"Talkies.AIF") 

// JavaScript syntax 

downLoadNetThing("http://www.cbDeMille.com/Talkies.AIF", 

_player.applicationPath + "Talkies.AIF"); 

membert"Norma Desmond Speaks").importFi1eInto(_player.applicationPath + 

"Talkies.AIF");

Description 

Movie method; duplicates the current frame and its content. 

The duplicate frame is inserted after the current frame and then becomes the current frame. 

This method can be used only during a Score recording session and performs the same function as 
the dupl i cateFrame() method. 


insertFrameQ 367 



Parameters 


None. 

Example 

The following handler generates a frame that has the transition cast member Fog assigned in the 
transition channel followed by a set of empty frames. The argument numberOf Frames sets the 
number of frames.

installMenu 

Usage 

installMenu whichCastMember 

Description 

Command; installs the menu defined in the field cast member specified by whi chCastMember. 
These custom menus appear only while the movie is playing. To remove the custom menus, use 
the instal IMenu command with no argument or with 0 as the argument. This command doesn’t 
work with hierarchical menus. 

For an explanation of how menu items are defined in a field cast member, see the menu keyword. 

Avoid changing menus many times because doing so affects system resources. 

In Windows, if the menu is longer than the screen, only part of the menu appears; on the 
Macintosh, menus longer than the screen can scroll. 

Note: Menus are not available in Shockwave Player. 


installMenu 369 



Parameters 

f 7 eldMemberObjRef Optional. Specifies the field cast member to which a menu is installed. 

Example 

This statement installs the menu defined in field cast member 37: 
insta11 Menu 37 

This statement installs the menu defined in the field cast member named Menubar: 
installMenu member "Menubar" 

This statement disables menus that were installed by the installMenu command: 
insta11 Menu 0

integer() 

Usage 

(numericExp res si on) .integer 
integer( numericExp res si on) 

Description 

Function (Lingo only); rounds the value of an expression to the nearest whole integer. 

You can force an integer to be a string by using the stri ng( ) function. 

In JavaScript syntax, use the parselnt( ) function. 

Parameters 

numericExpression Required. The number to round to an integer. 

Example 

This statement rounds off the number 3.75 to the nearest whole integer: 

put integer(3.75) 

-- 4 

The following statement rounds off the value in parentheses. This provides a usable value for the 
1 ocH sprite property, which requires an integer: 

sprite(1).1ocH = integer(0.333 * stageWidth)

floatO, stringO 


370 Chapter 12: Methods 



integerP() 

Usage 

exp ression.integerP 
(numeri c Exp res si on). i ntegerP 
integerP( expression ) 

Description 

Function (Lingo only); indicates whether a specified expression can be evaluated to an integer 
(1 or TRUE) or not (0 or FALSE). Pin i ntegerP stands for predicate. 

Parameters 

expression Required. The expression to test. 

Example 

This statement checks whether the number 3 can be evaluated to an integer and then displays 1 
(TRUE) in the Message window: 

put C 3).integerP 
-- 1 

The following statement checks whether the number 3 can be evaluated to an integer. Because 3 
is surrounded by quotation marks, it cannot be evaluated to an integer, so 0 ( FALSE) is displayed 
in the Message window: 

put("3").integerP 
-- 0 

This statement checks whether the numerical value of the string in field cast member Entry is an 
integer and if it isn’t, displays an alert: 

if field("Entry").value.integerP = FALSE then alert "Please enter an integer."

interface() 

Usage 

xtra( "XtraName ").interface!) 
i nterface(xtra "XtraName") 

Description 

Function; returns a Return-delimited string that describes the Xtra and lists its methods. This 
function replaces the now obsolete mMessageList function. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement displays the output from the function used in the QuickTime Asset Xtra in the 
Message window: 

put Xtra!"QuickTimeSupport").interface!) 


interface!) 371 




interpolate() 

Usage 

transforml . i nterpol ate( transform2,percentage) 

Description 

3D transform method; returns a copy of transforml created by interpolating from the position 
and rotation of transforml to the position and rotation of transform2 by the specified 
percentage. The original transforml is not affected. To interpolate transforml, use 
i nterpol ateTo(). 

To interpolate by hand, multiply the difference of two numbers by the percentage. For example, 
interpolation from 4 to 8 by 50 percent yields 6. 

Example 

In this example, tBox is the transform of the model named Box, and tSphere is the transform of 
the model named Sphere. The third line of the example interpolates a copy of the transform of 
Box halfway to the transform of Sphere. 

tBox = member("3d world").model("Box").transform 
tSphere = member("3d world").model("Sphere").transform 
tNew = tBox.interpolateltSphere, 50) 

See also 

interpolateTo() 

interpolateTo() 

Usage 

transforml . interpol ateTo( transform2, percentage ) 

Description 

3D transform method; modifies transforml by interpolating from the position and rotation 
of transforml to the position and rotation of a new transform by a specified percentage. The 
original transforml is changed. To interpolate a copy of transforml, use the interpolate! ) 
function. 

To interpolate by hand, multiply the difference of two numbers by the percentage. For example, 
interpolation from 4 to 8 by 50 percent yields 6. 

Parameters 

transform2 Required. Specifies the transform to which a given transform is interpolated. 
percentage Required. Specifies the rotation percentage of transf orm2. 

Example 

In this example, tBox is the transform of the model named Box, and tSphere is the transform of 
the model named Sphere. The third line of the example interpolates the transform of Box halfway 
to the transform of Sphere.

isBusy() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
soundChannelObjRef. isBusy!) 

// JavaScript syntax 
soundChannelObjRef. isBusy!); 

Description 

Sound Channel method; determines whether a sound is playing (TRUE) or not playing (FALSE) in 
a sound channel. 

Make sure that the playhead has moved before using i sBusy!) to check the sound channel. If 
this function continues to return FALSE after a sound should be playing, add the updateStage () 
method to start playing the sound before the playhead moves again. 

This method works for those sound channels occupied by actual audio cast members. 
QuickTime, Flash, and Shockwave Player audio handle sound differently, and this method will 
not work with those media types. 

Consider using the status property of a sound channel instead of i s B u sy (). The status 
property can be more accurate under many circumstances. 

Parameters 

None. 


374 Chapter 12: Methods 



Example 


The following statement checks whether a sound is playing in sound channel 1 and loops in the 
frame if it is. This allows the sound to finish before the playhead goes to another frame. 

-- Lingo syntax 
if (sound(l).isBusy!)) then 
_movie.go(_movie.frame) 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (sound!1).isBusy()) { 

_movie.go(_movie.frame);

member! whi chCastmember) . camera (w/)7 chCamera) .isInWorld!) 
member! whichCastmember ).1 ight(whichLight ). i slnWorl d() 
member! whichCastmember). group! whichGroup) .isInWorld!) 

Description 

3D command; returns a value of TRUE if the parent hierarchy of the model, camera, light, or 
group terminates in the world. If the value of i s I nWorl d is TRUE, the model, camera, light, or 
group functions in the 3D world of the cast member. 

Models, cameras, lights, and groups can be stored in a 3D cast member but not used in the 3D 
world of the cast member. Use the addToWorl d and removeFromWorl d commands to add and 
remove models, cameras, lights, and groups from the 3D world of the cast member. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement shows that the model named Teapot exists in the 3D world of the cast member 
named TableScene: 

put member!"TableScene").model("Teapot").isInWorld() 

-- 1

isPastCuePoint() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef. i sPastCuePoi nt( cuePointID) 

// JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. i sPastCuePoi nt( cuePoi ntID ); 

Description 

Function; determines whether a sprite or sound channel has passed a specified cue point in its 
media. This function can be used with sound (WAV, AIFF, SND, SWA, AU), QuickTime, or 
Xtra files that support cue points. 

Replace spri teNum or channel Num with a sprite channel or a sound channel. Shockwave Audio 
(SWA) sounds can appear as sprites in sprite channels, but they play sound in a sound channel. It 
is recommended that you refer to SWA sound sprites by their sprite channel number rather than 
their sound channel number. 

Replace cuePointID with a reference for a cue point: 

• If cuePoi ntID is an integer, i sPastCuePoi nt returns 1 if the cue point has been passed and 0 
if it hasn’t been passed. 

• If cuePointID is a name, i sPastCuePoi nt returns the number of cue points passed that have 
that name. 

If the value specified for cuePoi nt ID doesn’t exist in the sprite or sound, the function returns 0. 

The number returned by isPastCuePoint is based on the absolute position of the sprite in its 
media. For example, if a sound passes cue point Main and then loops and passes Main again, 
isPastCuePoint returns 1 instead of2. 

When the result of i sPastCuePoi nt is treated as a Boolean operator, the function returns TRUE if 
any cue points identified by cuePo i nt ID have passed and FALSE if no cue points are passed. 

Parameters 

cuePointID Required. A string or integer that specifies the name or number of the specified 
cue point. 

Example 

This statement plays a sound until the third time the cue point Chorus End is passed: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (sound!1).isPastCuePoint("Chorus End")=3) then 
souncK 1). stop() 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 

var ce = sound!1).isPastCuePoint("Chorus End"); 
if (ce = 3) I 
sound(1).stop(); 
i

The following example displays information in cast member “field 2” about the music playing in 
sound channel 1. If the music is not yet past cue point “climax”, the text of “field 2” is “This is the 
beginning of the piece.” Otherwise, the text reads “This is the end of the piece.” 

-- Lingo syntax 

if not sound!1).isPastCuePoint("climax") then 

member!"field 2").text = "This is the beginning of the piece." 
el se 

member!"field 2").text = "This is the end of the piece."

keyPressedQ 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_key.keyPressed!I keyCodeOrCharacter )) 


// JavaScript syntax 

_key.keyPressed!{ keyCodeOrCharacter )); 

Description 

Key method; returns the character string assigned to the key that was last pressed, or optionally 
whether a specified key was pressed. 

If the keyCodeOrCharacter parameter is omitted, this method returns the character string 
assigned to the last key that was pressed. If no key was pressed, this method returns an 
empty string. 

If the keyCodeOrCharacter is used to specify the key being pressed, this method returns TRUE if 
that particular key is being pressed, or FALSE if not. 

This method is updated when the user presses keys while in a repeat (Lingo) or for (JavaScript 
syntax) loop. This is an advantage over the key property, which doesn’t update while in a repeat 
or for loop. 

To test which characters correspond to different keys on different keyboards, use the Keyboard 
Lingo sample movie. 

Parameters 

keyCodeOrCharacter Optional. The key code or ASCII character string to test. 


keyPressedQ 377 



Example 


The following statement checks whether the user pressed the Enter key in Windows or the Return 
key on a Macintosh and runs the handler updateData if the key was pressed:

map() 389 





Example 

In this behavior, all of the sprites have already been set to draggable. Sprite 2b contains a small 
bitmap. Sprite Is is a rectangular shape sprite large enough to easily contain sprite 2b. Sprite 4b is 
a larger version of the bitmap in sprite 2b. Sprite 3s is a larger version of the shape in sprite Is. 
Moving sprite 2b or sprite Is will cause sprite 4b to move. When you drag sprite 2b, its 
movements are mirrored by sprite 4b. When you drag sprite Is, sprite 4b moves in the opposite 
direction. Resizing sprite 2b or sprite Is will also produce interesting results.

mci 


Usage 

mci "string" 

Description 

Command; for Windows only, passes the strings specified by string to the Windows Media 
Control Interface (MCI) for control of multimedia extensions. 

Note: Microsoft no longer recommends using the 16-bit MCI interface. Consider using third-party 
Xtra extensions for this functionality instead. 

Parameters 

string Required. A string that is passed to the MCI. 

Example 

The following statement makes the command pi ay cdaudio from 200 to 600 track 7 play 
only when the movie plays back in Windows: 

mci "play cdaudio from 200 to 600 track 1" 

memberO 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

member (memberNameOrNum {, castNameOrNum I) 

// JavaScript syntax 

memb erimemberNameOrNum {, castNameOrNum I); 

Description 

Top level function; creates a reference to a cast member, and optionally specifies the cast library 
that contains the member. 

The member () method is a specific reference to both a cast library and a member within it if used 
with both the memberNameOrNum and castNameOrNum parameters: 

trace(sprited) .member); 

// (member 1 of castLib 1) 

This method differs from the spriteNum property of a sprite, which is always an integer 
designating position in a cast library, but does not specify the cast library: 

trace(sprite(2).spriteNum); 

// 2 

The number of a member is also an absolute reference to a particular member in a particular cast 
library: 

trace(sprite(3).member.number) 

// 3 

Parameters 

memberNameOrNum Required. A string that specifies the name of the cast member to reference, or 
an integer that specifies the index position of the cast member to reference. 


394 Chapter 12: Methods 



castNameOrNum Optional. A string that specifies the cast library name to which the member 
belongs, or an integer that specifies the index position of the cast library to which the member 
belongs. If omitted, member!) searches all cast libraries until a match is found. 

Example 

This statements sets the variable memWi ngs to the cast member named Planes, which is in the cast 
library named Transportation. 

-- Lingo syntax 

memWings = member!"PIanes", "Transportation") 

// JavaScript syntax 

var memWings = member!"PIanes", "Transportation");

// JavaScript syntax 

memberObj Ref. move( { intPosn, castLibName ]); 

Description 

Member method; moves a specified cast member to either the first empty location in its 
containing cast, or to a specified location in a given cast. 

For best results, use this method during authoring, not at runtime, because the move is typically 
saved with the file. The actual location of a cast member does not affect most presentations 
during playback for an end user. To switch the content of a sprite or change the display during 
runtime, set the member of the sprite. 

Parameters 

intPosn Optional. An integer that specifies the position in the cast library castLi bName to 
which the member is moved. 

castL i bName Optional. A string that specifies the name of the cast library to which the member 
is moved.

list is empty, the face has no neighbors in that direction. If the list contains more than one list, the 
mesh is non-manifold. Usually the list contains a single list of four integer values: [mes h I ndex, 
facelndex, vertexlndex, flipped]. 

The value mesh Index is the index of the mesh containing the neighbor face. The value 
facelndex is the index of the neighbor face in that mesh. The value vertexlndex is the index of 
the nonshared vertices of the neighbor face. The value flipped describes whether the face 
orientation is the same as (1) or opposite (2) that of the original face. 

Parameters 

None.

net Abort 

Usage 

netAbort( URL) 
netAbort inetlD) 

Description 

Command; cancels a network operation without waiting for a result. 

Using a network ID is the most efficient way to stop a network operation. The ID is returned 
when you use a network function such as getNetText( ) or postNetText(). 

In some cases, when a network ID is not available, you can use a URL to stop the transmission of 
data for that URL. The URL must be identical to that used to begin the network operation. If the 
data transmission is complete, this command has no effect. 

Parameters 

URL Required. Specifies the URL to cancel. 

netID Optional. Specifies the ID of the network operation to cancel. 


netAbort 409 



Example 


This statement passes a network ID to netAbort to cancel a particular network operation: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseUp 

netAbort(myNetlD) 

end 

// JavaScript syntax 
functi on mousellp() { 
netAbort(myNetlD);

netDone() 

Usage 

netDone() 
netDone( netID) 

Description 

Function; indicates whether a background loading operation (such as getNetText, 
preloadNet Thing, gotoNetMovie, gotoNetPage, or netTextResul t) is finished or was 
terminated by a browser error (TRUE , default) or is still in progress (FALSE). 

• Use netDone ( ) to test the last network operation. 

• Use n e t D o n e ( n e 17 D) to test the network operation identified by n e 11 D. 

The netDone function returns 0 when a background loading operation is in progress. 

Parameters 

netID Optional. Specifies the ID of the network operation to test. 

Example 

The following handler uses the netDone function to test whether the last network operation has 
finished. If the operation is finished, text returned by netTextResul t is displayed in the field cast 
member Display Text. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame 

if netDone!) = 1 then

netError() 

Usage 

netErrorC) 
netError! netID) 

Description 

Function; determines whether an error has occurred in a network operation and, if so, returns an 
error number corresponding to an error message. If the operation was successful, this function 
returns a code indicating that everything is okay. If no background loading operation has started, 
or if the operation is in progress, this function returns an empty string. 

• Use netError!) to test the last network operation. 

• Use netError! netID) to test the network operation specified by netID. 

Several possible error codes may be returned: 

0 Everything is okay. 

4 Bad MOA class. The required network or nonnetwork Xtra extensions are improperly 

installed or not installed at all.

netLastModDate() 

Usage 

netLastModDate() 

Description 

Function; returns the date last modified from the HTTP header for the specified item. The string 
is in Universal Time (GMT) format: Ddd, nn Mmm yyyy hh:mm:ss GMT (for example, Thu, 30 
Jan 1997 12:00:00 AM GMT). There are variations where days or months are spelled completely. 
The string is always in English. 


412 Chapter 12: Methods 



The net Last ModDate function can be called only after netDone and net Error report that the 
operation is complete and successful. After the next operation starts, the Director movie or 
projector discards the results of the previous operation to conserve memory. 

The actual date string is pulled directly from the HTTP header in the form provided by 
the server. However, this string is not always provided, and in that case netLastModDate 
returns EMPTY. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

These statements check the date of a file downloaded from the Internet: 

-- Lingo syntax 
if netDone() then 

theDate = netLastModDate!) 
if theDate.char[6..11] <> "Jan 30" then 
alert "The file is outdated." 
end i f 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (netDone!)) ( 

theDate = netLastModDate!);

netMIMEO 

Usage 

netMIMEO 

Description 

Function; provides the MIME type of the Internet file that the last network operation returned 
(the most recently downloaded HTTP or FTP item). 

The netMIME function can be called only after netDone and netError report that the operation 
is complete and successful. After the next operation starts, the Director movie or projector 
discards the results of the previous operation to conserve memory. 

Parameters 

None.

netTextResult() 

Usage 

netTextResult (net ID) 
netTextResult() 

Description 

Function; returns the text obtained by the specified network operation. If no net ID is specified, 
netTextResul t returns the result of the last network operation. 

If the specified network operation was getNetText! ), the text is the text of the file on 
the network. 

If the specified network operation was postNetText, the result is the servers response. 

After the next operation starts, Director discards the results of the previous operation to 
conserve memory. 

When a movie plays back as an applet, this function returns valid results for the last 10 requests. 
When a movie plays back as a movie with Shockwave content, this function returns valid results 
for only the most recent getNetText! ) operation. 

Parameters 

net ID Optional. Specifies the ID of the network operation that contains the text to return. 

Example 

This handler uses the "netDone and netError" functions to test whether the last network 
operation finished successfully. If the operation is finished, text returned by netTextResul t is 
displayed in the field cast member Display Text. 

-- Lingo syntax 
global gNetID 

on exitFrame 

if (netDone(gNetlD) = TRUE) and (netError(gNetlD) = "OK") then 
member!"Display Text").text = netTextResult()

new() 

Usage 

new( type) 

new( type, castLib whichCast) 

new (type, member whichCastMember of castLib whichCast ) 
variableName = r\ew(parentScript argl, arg2, ...) 
new(script parentScriptName, valuel, value2, . ..) 

timeout! "name ").new( timoutPeriod, fttimeoutHandler , {, targetObject }) 
new(xtra "xtraName") 

Description 

Function; creates a new cast member, child object, timeout object, or Xtra instance and allows 
you to assign of individual property values to child objects. 

For cast members, the type parameter sets the cast member’s type. Possible predefined values 
correspond to the existing cast member types: #bi tmap, #fi el d, and so on. The new function can 
also create Xtra cast member types, which can be identified by any name that the author chooses. 

It’s also possible to create a new color cursor cast member using the Custom Cursor Xtra. Use 
new(#cursor ) and set the properties of the resulting cast member to make them available for use. 

The optional whi chCastMember and whichCast parameters specify the cast member slot and 
Cast window where the new cast member is stored. When no cast member slot is specified, the 
first empty slot is used. The new function returns the cast member slot. 

When the argument for the new function is a parent script, the new function creates a 

child object. The parent script should include an on new handler that sets the child object’s initial 

state or property values and returns the me reference to the child object. 

The child object has all the handlers of the parent script. The child object also has the same 
property variable names that are declared in the parent script, but each child object has its own 
values for these properties. 

Because a child object is a value, it can be assigned to variables, placed in lists, and passed 
as a parameter. 

As with other variables, you can use the put command to display information about a child object 
in the Message window. 

When new () is used to create a timeout object, the timeoutPeriod sets the number of milliseconds 
between timeout events sent by the timeout object. The tttimeoutHandler is a symbol that 
identifies the handler that will be called when each timeout event occurs. The targetObject 
identifies the name of the child object that contains the tttimeoutHandl er. If no targetObject 
is given, the fttimeoutHandler is assumed to be in a movie script. 


416 Chapter 12: Methods 



When a timeout object is created, it enables its targetObject to receive the system events 
prepareMovie, startMovie, stopMovie, prepareFrame, and exi tFrame. To take advantage of 
this, the targetObject must contain handlers for these events. The events do not need to be 
passed in order for the rest of the movie to have access to them. 

To see an example of new() used in a completed movie, see the Parent Scripts, and Read and 
Write Text movies in the Learning/Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

To create a new bitmap cast member in the first available slot, you use this syntax: 
set newMember = new(#bitmap) 

After the line has been executed, newMember will contain the member reference to the cast 
member just created: 

put newMember 

-- (member 1 of castLib 1) 

The following startMovie script creates a new Flash cast member using the new command, sets the 
newly created cast member’s 1 i nked property so that the cast member’s assets are stored in an 
external file, and then sets the cast member’s pathName property to the location of a Flash movie 
on the World Wide Web: 

on startMovie 

f1ashCastMember = new(#flash) 

member(f1ashCastMember).pathName = "http://www.someURL.com/my FI ash.swf" 
end 

When the movie starts, this handler creates a new animated color cursor cast member and stores 
its cast member number in a variable called customCursor. This variable is used to set the 
castMember Li st property of the newly created cursor and to switch to the new cursor. 

on startmovie 

customCursor = new(#cursor) 

member(customCursor).castMemberList = [member 1, member 2, member 3] 
cursor (member(customCursor)) 
end 

These statements from a parent script include the on new handler to create a child object. The 
parent script is a script cast member named Bird, which contains these handlers. 

on new me, nameForBird 
return me 
end 

on fly me 

put "I am flying" 
end 

The first statement in the following example creates a child object from the above script in the 
preceding example, and places it in a variable named myBi rd. The second statement makes the 
bird fly by calling the fly handler in the Bird parent script: 

myBird = script("Bird").new() 
myBi rd . fly() 


new() 417 



This statement uses a new Bird parent script, which contains the property variable speed: 
property speed 

on new me, initSpeed 
speed = initSpeed 
return me 
end 

on fly me 

put "I am flying at " & speed & "mph" 
end 

The following statements create two child objects called myBirdl and myBird2. They are given 
different starting speeds: 15 and 25, respectively. When the fly handler is called for each child 
object, the speed of the object is displayed in the Message window. 

myBirdl = script("Bird").new(15) 
myBird2 = script("Bird").new(25) 
myBirdl.f1y() 
myBird2.fly() 

This message appears in the Message window: 

-- "I am flying at 15 mph" 

-- "I am flying at 25 mph" 

This statement creates a new timeout object called intervalTimer that will send a timeout event to 
the on minuteBeep handler in the child object playerOne every 60 seconds: 

timeout("intervalTimer").new( 60000 , #minuteBeep, piayerOne)

newCamera 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .newCamera( newCameraName) 

Description 

3D command; creates a new camera within a cast member. 

Parameters 

newCameraName Required. Specifies the name of the new camera. The name of the new camera 
must be unique within the cast member. 

Example 

This statement creates a new camera called in-car camera:

newCurve() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberObjRef. newCu rvelpositionlnVertexList) 

// JavaScript syntax 

memberObjRef. newCu rve(.pos i ti onlnVertexLi st); 

Description 

Function; adds a #newCurve symbol to the vertexLi st of vectorCastMember, which adds a 
new shape to the vector shape. You can break apart an existing shape by calling newCurvel ) with 
a position in the middle of a series of vertices. 

Parameters 

positi onlnVertexLi st Required. Specifies the position in the vertexLi st at which the 
#newCurve symbol is added. 

Example 

These statements add a new curve to cast member 2 at the third position in the cast member’s 
vertexList. The second line of the example replaces the contents of curve 2 with the contents of 
curve 3. 

-- Lingo syntax 

member(2),newCurve(3) 

member(2),curve[2] = member(2),curve[3] 

// JavaScript syntax 

member(2).newCurve(3); 

member(2),curve[2] = member(2),curve[3];

newGroup 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember). newGroup( newGroupName) 

Description 

3D command; creates a new group and adds it to the group palette. 

Parameters 

newGroupName Required. Specifies the name of the new group. The name of the new group must 
be unique within the group palette. 

Example 

This statement creates a group called gbGroup2 within the cast member Scene, and a reference to 
it is stored in the variable ng: 

ng = member("Scene").newGroup("gbGroup2") 


newGroup 419 



newLight 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) . newLight( newLightName , tttypelndicat or) 

Description 

3D command; creates a new light with a specified type, and adds it to the light palette. 

Parameters 

newL / ghtName Required. Specifies the name of the new light. The name of the new light must be 
unique within the light palette. 

typelndi cator Required. A symbol that specifies the type of the new light. Valid values include 
the following:

• #di recti onal is a light from a specific direction. 

• #poi nt is a light source like a light bulb. 

• #spot is a spotlight effect. 

Example 

The following statement creates a new light in the cast member named 3D World. It is an 
ambient light called "ambient room light". 

member("3D World").newLight("ambient room light", #ambient) 

newMember() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.newMember( symbo1 ) 

_movie.newMember( stringMemberType) 

II JavaScript syntax 

_movie.newMember ( stringMemberType ); 

Description 

Movie method; creates a new cast member and allows you to assign individual property values to 
child objects. 

For new cast members, the symbo 1 or stri ngMemberType parameter sets the cast member’s type. 
Possible predefined values correspond to the existing cast member types: #bi tmap, Iff i el d, and so 
on. The newMembe r () method can also create Xtra cast member types, which can be identified by 
any name that the author chooses. 

It’s also possible to create a new color cursor cast member using the Custom Cursor Xtra. Use 
newMember (ffcursor) and set the properties of the resulting cast member to make them available 
for use. 

After newMembe r () is called, the new cast member is placed in the first empty cast library slot.

newMemberQ 421 



newMesh 


Usage 

member ( whichCastmember) . newMesh ( name,numFaces, numVertices, 
numNormals,numColors,numTextureCoordinates) 

Description 

3D command; creates a new mesh model resource. After creating a mesh, you must set values for 
at least the vertexLi st and facet index ] . verti ces properties of the new mesh, followed by a 
call to its b u i 1 d () command, in order to actually generate the geometry. 

Parameters 

meshName Required. Specifies the name of the new mesh model resource. 

numFaces Required. Specifies the desired total number of triangles you want in the mesh. 

numVerti ces Required. Specifies the total number of vertices used by all the (triangular) faces. A 
vertex may be shared by more than one face. 

numNormal s Optional. Specifies the total number of normals. A normal may be shared by more 
than one face. The normal for a corner of a triangle defines which direction is outward, affecting 
how that corner is illuminated by lights. Enter 0 or omit this parameter if you are going to use the 
mesh’s generateNormalsl ) command to generate normals. 

numCo 1 ors Optional. Specifies the total number of colors used by all the faces. A color may be 
shared by more than one face. You can specify a color for each corner of each face. Specify colors 
for smooth color gradation effects. Enter 0 or omit this parameter to get default white color per 
face corner. 

numTextureCoordi nates Optional. Specifies the number of user-specified texture coordinates 
used by all the faces. Enter 0 or omit this parameter to get the default texture coordinates 
generated via a planar mapping. (See the explanation of #pl anar in the 

shader. textureWrapMode entry for more details). Specify texture coordinates when you need 
precise control over how textures are mapped onto the faces of the mesh. 

Example 

This example creates a model resource of the type #mesh, specifies its properties, and then creates 
a new model from the model resource. The process is outlined in the following line-by-line 
explanation of the example code: 

Line 1 creates a mesh containing 6 faces, composed of 5 unique vertices and 3 unique colors. The 
number of normals and the number of textureCoordi nates are not set. The normals will be 
created by the generateNormal s command. 

Line 2 defines the five unique vertices used by the faces of the mesh. 

Line 3 defines the three unique colors used by the faces of the mesh. 

Lines 4 through 9 assign which vertices to use as the corners of each face in the Pyramid. Note 
the clockwise ordering of the vertices. GenerateNormal s () relies on a clockwise ordering. 

Lines 10 through 15 assign colors to the corners of each face. The colors will spread across the 
faces in gradients. 

Line 16 creates the normals of Triangle by calling the generateNormal s ( ) command. 


422 Chapter 12: Methods 



Line 17 calls the build command to construct the mesh. 

nm = member!"Shapes").newMesh("pyramid",6 , 5, 0, 3) 
nm.vertexList = [ vector(0,0,0), vector(40,0,0), \ 
vector(40,0,40), vector(0,0,40), vector(20,50,20) ]

newModel 423 




newModelResource 

Usage 

memberti iihi chCastmember) .newModel Resource( newModel ResourceName \ 

{ ,#type, # facing )) 

Description 

3D command; creates a new model resource, optionally of a give type and facing, and adds it to 
the model resource palette. 

If you do not choose to specify the facing parameter and specify # box, #sphere, #parti cl e or 

• cyl i nder for the type parameter, only the front faces are generated. If you specify #pl ane, both 
the front and back faces are generated. Model resources of the type #pl ane have two meshes 
generated (one for each side), and consequently has two shaders in the shaderList. 

A facing of #both creates the double amount of meshes and consequently produces double the 
number of shader entries in the shaderList. There will be 2 for planes and spheres (for the inside 
and outside of the model respectively), 12 for cubes (6 on the outside, 6 on the inside), and 6 for 
cylinders (top, hull and bottom outside, and another set for the inside). 

Parameters 

newMode 1 ResourceName Required. Specifies the name of the new model resource. 

type Optional. Specifies the primitive type of the new model resource. Valid values are as follows: 

• #plane 

• #box 

• #sphere 

• #cylinder 

• #particle 

facing Optional. Specifies the face of the new model resource. Valid values are as follows: 

• #front 

• #back 

• #both 

Example 

The following handler creates a box. The first line of the handler creates a new model resource 
called boxlO. Its type is #box, and it is set to show only its back. The next three lines set the 
dimensions of boxlO and the last line creates a new model which uses boxlO as its model 
resource. 

on makeBox 

nmr = member!"3D").newModelResource!"boxlO", #box, #back) 
nmr.height = 50 
nmr.width = 50 
nmr.length = 50 

aa = member!"3D").newModel("gb5", nmr) 
end

newMotion() 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .newMotion! name ) 

Description 

3D command; creates a new motion within a referenced cast member, and returns a reference to 
the new motion. A new motion can be used to combine several previously existing motions from 
the member’s motion list via the map!) command. 

Parameters 

name Required. Specifies the name of the new motion. The name of the new motion must be 
unique within the referenced cast member. 

Example 

This Lingo creates a new motion in member 1 called runWithWave that is used to combine the 
run and wave motions from the member’s motion list: 

runWithWave = member!1).newMotion("runWithWave") 
runWithWave.map!"run", "pelvisBone") 
runWithWave.map!"wave", "shoulderBone") 

newObject() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef.newObjecttobjectType {, argl, arg2 ....)) 

// JavaScript syntax 

spriteObjRef.newObjecttobjectType {, argl, arg2 ....)); 

Description 

Flash sprite command; creates an ActionScript object of the specified type. 

The following syntax creates an object within a Flash sprite: 

fl ashSpri teReference.neviObjectt" objectType" 1, argl, arg2 ....)) 

The following syntax creates a global object: 
newObject ("objectType" {, argl, arg2 ....)) 

Note: If you have not imported any Flash cast members, you must manually add the Flash Asset Xtra 
to your movie’s Xtra list in order for global Flash commands to work correctly in the Shockwave 
Player and projectors. You add Xtra extensions to the Xtra list by choosing Modify > Movie > Xtras. For 
more information about managing Xtra extensions for distributed movies, see the Using Director 
topics in the Director Help Panel. 


newObjectQ 425 




Parameters 


objectType Required. Specifies the type of new object to create. 

argl, arg2, ... Optional. Specifies any initialization arguments required by the object. Each 
argument must be separated by a comma. 

Example 

This Lingo sets the variable tLocal ConObject to a reference to a new Local Connecti on object 
in the Flash movie in sprite 3: 

-- Lingo syntax 

tLocalConObject = sprite(3).newObject!"LocalConnection") 

// JavaScript syntax 

var tLocalConObject = sprite(3).newObject!"LocalConnection”); 

The following Lingo sets the variable tArrayOb ject to a reference to a new array object in the 
flash movie in sprite 3. The array contains the 3 integer values 23, 34, and 19.

newShader 

Usage 

member! uhichCastmember). newShader! newShaderName, tfshaderType) 

Description 

3D command; creates a new shader of a specified shader type within a referenced cast member’s 
shader list and returns a reference to the new shader. 

Each type of shader has a specific group of properties that can be used with that type of shader, in 
addition all shader types have access to the #standard shader properties. However, although you 
can assign any #standa rd shader property to a shader of another type, the property may not have 
a visual effect. This happens in cases where the #standard property, if applied, would override the 
nature of the shader type. An example of this is the di ff useLi ghtMap standard shader property, 
which is ignored by #engraver, #newspri nt, and #pai nter type shaders. 


426 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters 

newShaderName Required. Specifies the name of the new shader. The name of the new shader 
must be unique in the shader list. 

shaderType Required. A symbol that determines the style in which the shader is applied. Valid 
values include the following: 

• #standard shaders are photorealistic, and have the following properties: ambi ent, bl end, 
blendConstant, blendConstantList, blendFunction, blendFunctionList, blendSource, 
blendSourceList, diffuse, diffuseLightMap, emissive, flat, glossMap, ilk, name, 
region, renderStyle, silhouettes, specular, specul arLi ghtMap, texture, 
textureMode, textureModeLi st, textureRepeat, textureRepeatLi st, 
textureTransform, textureTransformLi st, transparent, useDiffuseWithTexture, 
wrapTransform, and wrapTransformLi st. 

• #pa i nter shaders are smoothed out, have the appearance of a painting, and have the following 
properties in addition to all of the #standard properties: col orSteps, hi 1 i ghtPercentage, 
hi 1 i ghtStrength, name, shadowPercentage, shadowStrength, and styl e. 

• #engraver shaders are lined, have the appearance of an engraving, and have the following 
properties in addition to all of the #standard properties: bri ghtness, densi ty, name, 
and rotati on. 

• #newspri nt shaders are in a simulated dot style, have the appearance of a newspaper 
reproduction, and have the following properties in addition to all of the #standard properties: 
bri ghtness, densi ty, and name. 

Example 

This statement creates a #pai nter shader called newPainter: 

newPainter = member("3D World").newShader("newPainter",#painter)

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .newTexture! newTextureName \ 

1 .lltypelndicator, sourceObjectReference)) 

Description 

3D command; creates a new texture within the referenced member’s texture palette and returns a 
reference to the new texture. The only way cast member textures will work is if you specify the 
cast member in the newTexture constructor. 

Parameters 

newTextureName Required. Specifies the name of the new texture. The name of the new texture 
must be unique in the referenced cast member’s texture palette. 

typelnd i cator Optional. Specifies the type of the new texture. If omitted, the new texture is

sourceObjectReference Optional. Specifies a reference to the source cast member or Lingo 
image object. If omitted, the new texture is created from no specific source. 
sourceObjectReference must refer to a cast member if typelndicator is #fromCastMember, 
and it must refer to a Lingo image object if typelndi cator is #f romlmageObj ect. 

Example 

The first line of this statement creates a new texture called Grass 02 from cast member 5 of 
castlib 1. The second line creates a blank new texture called Blank. 

member("3D World").newTexture!"Grass \ 

02”,#fromCastMember.member!5,1)) 
member! "3D Worl d"). newTexture! "ESI ank") 

normalize 

Usage 

normalize( vector ) 
vector. normal i ze() 

Description 

3D command; normalizes a vector by dividing the x, y, and z components by the vector’s 
magnitude. Vectors that have been normalized always have a magnitude of 1.

nothing 

Usage 

nothing 

Description 

Command; does nothing. This command is useful for making the logic of an if. . .then 
statement more obvious. A nested if. . .then. . .else statement that contains no explicit 
command for the el se clause may require el se nothi ng, so that Lingo does not interpret the 
else clause as part of the preceding i f clause. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

The nested if. . .then. . .else statement in this handler uses the nothing command to satisfy 
the statement’s else clause: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown 

if the clickOn = 1 then 

if sprite(1).moveabl eSprite = TRUE then 
member!"Notice").text = "Drag the ball" 
else nothing 

else member!"Notice").text = "Click again" 
end i f

member!"Notice").text = "Drag the ball": 

! else { 

// do nothing 

1 

} else 1 

member!"Notice") .text = "Click again"; 


This handler instructs the movie to do nothing so long as the mouse button is being pressed:

// JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. nudge(#c/7 recti on) ; 

Description 

QuickTime VR command; nudges the view perspective of the specified QuickTime VR sprite in 
a specified direction. 

Nudging to the right causes the image of the sprite to move to the left. The nudge command has 
no return value. 

Parameters 

direction Required. Specifies the direction to nudge the view perspective. Valid values include 
the following: 

• #down 

• #downLeft 

• #downRight 

• #1 eft 

• #right 

• #up 

• #upLeft 

• #upRight 

Example 

This handler causes the perspective of the QTVR sprite to move to the left as long as the mouse 
button is held down on the sprite:

numToCharO 

Usage 

numToChar( integerExpression) 

Description 

Function; displays a string containing the single character whose ASCII number is the value of a 
specified expression. This function is useful for interpreting data from outside sources that are 
presented as numbers rather than as characters. 

ASCII values up to 127 are standard on all computers. Values of 128 or greater refer to different 
characters on different computers. 

Parameters 

7 ntegerExpress ion Required. Specifies the ASCII number whose corresponding character 
is returned. 

Example 

This statement displays in the Message window the character whose ASCII number is 65: 
put numToChar(65) 

The result is the letter A. 

This handler removes any nonalphabetic characters from any arbitrary string and returns only 
capital letters: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on ForceUppercase input 
output = EMPTY 
num = 1ength(input) 
repeat with i = 1 to num 

theASCII = charToNumlinput.char[i ]) 
if theASCII = min(max(96, theASCII), 123) then 
theASCII = theASCII - 32 

if theASCII = min(max(63, theASCII), 91) then 
put numToCharttheASCII) after output 
end i f 
end i f 
end repeat 
return output 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function ForceUpperCaselinput) { 
output = ""; 
num = input.1ength; 
for (i=l;i<=num;i++) { 

theASCII = input.char[i].charToNuml): 
if (theASCII == min(max(96, theASCII), 123) { 
theASCII = theASCII - 32; 
if (theASCII == min(max(63, theASCII), 91) { 
output = output + theASCII.numToChar(); 


return output;

objectP() 

Usage 

objectP( expression ) 

Description 

Function; indicates whether a specified expression is an object produced by a parent script, Xtra, 
or window (TRUE) or not (FALSE). 

The P in objectP stands for predicate. 

It is good practice to use objectP to determine which items are already in use when you create 
objects by parent scripts or Xtra instances. 

To see an example ofobjectPC) used in a completed movie, see the Read and Write Text movie 
in the Learning/Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters 

expression Required. Specifies the expression to test. 

Example 

This Lingo checks whether the global variable gDataBase has an object assigned to it and, if not, 
assigns one. This check is commonly used when you perform initializations at the beginning of a 
movie or section that you don’t want to repeat. 

-- Lingo syntax 
if objectP(gDataBase) then 
nothing 
el se 

gDataBase = script("Database Controller").new() 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (objectP(gDataBase)) { 

// do nothing 
! else ( 

gDataBase = script("Database Control 1er").new();

offset() (string function) 

Usage 

offset! stringExpressionl. stringExpression2) 

Description 

Function; returns an integer indicating the position of the first character of a string in another 
string. This function returns 0 if the first string is not found in the second string. Lingo counts 
spaces as characters in both strings. 

On the Macintosh, the string comparison is not sensitive to case or diacritical marks. For 
example, Lingo considers a and A to be the same character on the Macintosh. 


432 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters 

stringExpressionl Required. Specifies the sub-string to search for in stringExpression2. 

stringExpression2 Required. Specifies the string that contains the sub-string 

stri ngExpressi onl. 

Example 

This statement displays in the Message window the beginning position of the string “media” 
within the string “Macromedia”: 

put offset!"media","Macromedia") 

The result is 6. 

This statement displays in the Message window the beginning position of the string “Micro” 
within the string “Macromedia”: 

put offset!"Micro", "Macromedia") 

The result is 0, because “Macromedia” doesn’t contain the string “Micro”. 

This handler finds all instances of the string represented by stringToFind within the string 
represented by input and replaces them with the string represented by stringToInsert: 

-- Lingo syntax 

on SearchAndReplace input, stringToFind, stringToInsert 
output = "" 

findLen = stringToFind.Iength - 1 
repeat while input contains stringToFind 
currOffset = offset!stringToFind, input) 
output = output & input.char [1..currOffset] 
delete the last char of output 
output = output & stringToInsert 
delete input.char [1.. (currOffset + findLen)] 
end repeat 

set output = output & input 
return output 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function SearchAndReplace!input, stringToFind, stringToInsert) { 
output = ""; 

findLen = stringToFind.1ength - 1; 
do j 

currOffset = offset(stringToFind, input): 
output = output + input.char[0..currOffset]; 
output = output.substr(0,output.length-2); 
output = output + stringToInsert; 

input = input.substr!currOffset+findLen,input.1ength); 

} while (input.indexOf!stringToFind) >= 0); 
output = output + input; 
return output;

offset() (rectangle function) 

Usage 

rectangle.offset( horizonta1 Change, vertica1 Change) 
offset ( rectangle, horizontalChange , vertical Change) 

Description 

Function; yields a rectangle that is offset from the rectangle specified by rectangle. 

Parameters 

horizonta IChange Required. Specifies the horizontal offset, in pixels. When 
horizonta IChange is greater than 0, the offset is toward the right of the Stage; when 
horizonta IChange is less than 0, the offset is toward the left of the Stage. 

vertica IChange Required. Specifies the vertical offset, in pixels. When vertica IChange is 
greater than 0, the offset is toward the top of the Stage; when verti ca IChange is less than 0, the 
offset is toward the bottom of the Stage. 

Example 

This handler moves sprite 1 five pixels to the right and five pixels down: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on diagonalMove 

newRect=spri ted), rect.offset (5, 5) 
sprite(l).rect=newRect 
end 

// JavaScript syntax

open() (Player) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.open!{ stringDocPath ,1 stringAppPath) 

II JavaScript syntax 

_player.open!{ stringDocPath ,1 stringAppPath); 

Description 

Player method; opens a specified application, and optionally opens a specified file when the 
applicatin opens. 

When either stri ngDocPath or stri ngAppPath are in a different folder than the current movie, 
you must specify the full pathname to the file or files. 

The computer must have enough memory to run both Director and other applications at the 
same time. 

This is a very simple method for opening an application or a document within an application. For 
more control, look at options available in third-party Xtra extensions. 


434 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters 

stringDocPath Optional. A string that specifies the document to open when the application 
specified by stringAppPath opens. 

stri ngAppPath Required. A string that specifies the path to the application to open. 

Example 

This statement opens the TextEdit application, which is in the folder Applications on the drive 
HD (Macintosh), and the document named Storyboards: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.open ( "Storyboards ", "HD: Applications : Text Edit ") 

// JavaScript syntax 

_player.open("Storyboards" , "HD :Applications:Text Edit " );

open() (Window) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
wi ndowObjRef. open() 

// JavaScript syntax 
windowObjRef .open( ); 

Description 

Window method; opens a window and positions it in front of all other windows. 

If no movie is assigned to the window on which open () is called, the Open File dialog 
box appears. 

If the reference to the window object wi ndowObj Ref is replaced with a movie’s filename, the 
window uses the filename as the window name. However, a movie must then be assigned to the 
window by using the window’s f i 1 eName property. 

If the reference to the window object wi ndowObj Ref is replaced with a window name, the 
window takes that name. However, a movie must then be assigned to the window by using the 
window’s fi 1 eName property. 

To open a window that uses a movie from a URL, use downl oadNetThi ng() to download the 
movie’s file to a local disk first, and then use the file on the disk. This procedure minimizes 
problems with waiting for the movie to download. 

When using a local movie, use preloadMovief) to load at least the first frame of the movie prior 
to calling open (). This procedure reduces the possibility of movie load delays. 

Opening a movie in a window is currently not supported in playback using a browser. 

Parameters 

None. 


openQ (Window) 435 




Example 

This statement opens the window Control Panel and brings it to the front: 

-- Lingo syntax 

window("Control Panel").open() 

// JavaScript syntax

openXIib 

Usage 

openXIib whichFile 

Description 

Command; opens a specified Xlibrary file. 

It is good practice to close any file you have opened as soon as you are finished using it. The 
openXIib command has no effect on an open file. 

The openXl i b command doesn’t support URLs as file references. 

Xlibrary files contain Xtra extensions. Unlike openResFile, openXIib makes these Xtra 
extensions known to Director. 

When you open a Scripting Xtra extension using openXl i b, you must use cl oseXl i b to close it 
when Director is finished using it. 


436 Chapter 12: Methods 



In Windows, the .dll extension is optional. 

Note: This command is not supported in Shockwave Player. 

Parameters 

wh 7 chFi 1 e Required. Specifies the Xlibrary file to open. If the file is not in the folder containing 
the current movie, wh i chFi 1 e must include the pathname. 

Example 

This statement opens the Xlibrary file Video Disc Xlibrary: 
openXlib "Video Disc Xlibrary" 

This statement opens the Xlibrary file Xtras, which is in a different folder than the current movie: 
openXlib "My Drive:New Stuff:Transporter Xtras"

param() 

Usage 

param( parameterPosition) 

Description 

Function; provides the value of a parameter passed to a handler. 

To avoid errors in a handler, this function can be used to determine the type of a particular 
parameter. 

Parameters 

parameterPosi ti on Required. Specifies the parameters position in the arguments passed to 
a handler. 

Example 

This handler accepts any number of arguments, adds all the numbers passed in as parameters, and 
then returns the sum: 

--Lingo syntax 
on AddNumbers 
sum = 0 

repeat with currentParamNum = 1 to the paramCount 
sum = sum + param(currentParamNum) 
end repeat 
return sum 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function AddNumbers!) { 
sum = 0; 

for (currentParamNum=l;currentParamNum<=paramCount; currentParamNum++) { 
sum = sum + param(currentParamNum); 

1 

return sum; 

1 


param() 437 




You would use it by passing in the values you wanted to add: 

put AddNumbers(3, 4, 5, 6) 

-- 18 

put AddNumbers(5, 5) 

-- 10

paramCount() 

Usage 

the paramCount 

Description 

Function; indicates the number of parameters sent to the current handler. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable counter to the number of parameters that were sent to the 
current handler: 

set counter = the paramCount 

parseString() 

Usage 

parserObject .parseString (stringToParse) 

Description 

Function; used to parse an XML document that is already fully available to the Director movie. 
The first parameter is the variable containing the parser object. The return value is <V0I D> if the 
operation succeeds, or an error code number string if it fails. Failure is usually due to a problem 
with the XML syntax or structure. Once the operation is complete, the parser object contains the 
parsed XML data. 

To parse XML at a URL, use parseURU ). 

Parameters 

stringToParse Required. Specifies the string ofXML data to parse. 

Example 

This statement parses the XML data in the text cast member XMLtext. Once the operation is 
complete, the variable gPa rserOb ject will contain the parsed XML data. 

errorCode = gParserObject.parseString(member("XMLtext"))

438 Chapter 12: Methods 



parseURL() 

Usage 

parserObject . par sell RL( URLstring {.ii handl erToCa 11 On Comp 1 eti on) I, 
objectContainingHandler )) 

Description 

Function; parses an XML document that resides at an external Internet location. The first 
parameter is the parser object containing an instance of the XML Parser Xtra. 

This function returns immediately, so the entire URL may not yet be parsed. It is important to 
use the doneParsingO function in conjunction with parseURLO to determine when the 
parsing operation is complete. 

Since this operation is asynchronous, meaning it may take some time, you can use optional 
parameters to call a specific handler when the operation completes. 

The return value is void if the operation succeeds, or an error code number string if it fails. 

To parse XML locally, use parseStri ng(). 

Parameters 

URLstring Required. Specifies the actual URL at which the XML data resides. 

handl erToCal 1 On Comp 1 eti on Optional. Specifies the name of the handler that is to be executed 
once the URL is fully parsed. 

objectContai ni ngHandl er Optional. Specifies the name of the script object containing the 
handler handl erToCa 11 OnCompl eti on. If omitted, the handler is assumed to be a movie handler. 

Example 

This statement parses the file sample.xml at MyCompany.com. Use doneParsingO to determine 
when the parsing operation has completed. 

errorCode = gParserObject.parseURLU'http://www.MyCompany.com/samp1e.xml") 

This Lingo parses the file sample.xml and calls the on parseDone handler. Because no script 
object is given with the doneParsi ng( ) function, the on parseDone handler is assumed to be in 
a movie script. 

errorCode = gParserObject.parseURLU'http://www.MyCompany.com/samp1e.xml", 
#parseDone) 

The movie script contains the on parseDone handler: 

on parseDone 

global gParserObject 

if voidP(gParserObject.getError()) then 
put "Successful parse" 
el se 

put "Parse error:" 

put " " & gParserObject.getError() 

end if 
end 


parseURLO 439 



This Lingo parses the document sample.xml at MyCompany.com and calls the on parseDone 
handler in the script object testOb j ect, which is a child of the parent script TestScript: 

parserObject = new(xtra "XMLParser") 

testObject = new(script "TestScript", parserObject) 

errorCode = gParserObject.parsellRL("http: //www. My Company . com/s amp 1 e .xml", 
#parseDone, testObject) 

Here is the parent script TestScript: 

property myParserObject 

on new me, parserObject 

myParserObject = parserObject 
end 

on parseDone me 

if voidP(myParserObject.getError()) then 
put "Successful parse" 
el se 

put "Parse error:" 

put " " & myParserObject.getError() 

end i f 
end

pass 

Usage 

pass 

Description 

Command; passes an event message to the next location in the message hierarchy and enables 
execution of more than one handler for a given event. 

The pass command branches to the next location as soon as the command runs. Any Lingo that 
follows the pass command in the handler does not run. 

By default, an event message stops at the first location containing a handler for the event, usually 
at the sprite level. 

If you include the pass command in a handler, the event is passed to other objects in the 
hierarchy even though the handler would otherwise intercept the event. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This handler checks the key presses being entered, and allows them to pass through to the editable 
text sprite if they are valid characters: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on keyDown me 

1egalCharacters = "1234567890" 
if 1 egal Characters contains the key then 
pass

pasteClipBoardlnto() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberObjRef. pasted i pBoardlntoi) 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. pasted i pBoardlntoi); 

Description 

Member method; pastes the contents of the Clipboard into a specified cast member, and erases 
the existing cast member. 

Any item that is in a format that Director can use as a cast member can be pasted. 

When copying a string from another application, the string’s formatting is not retained. 

This method provides a convenient way to copy objects from other movies and from other 
applications into the Cast window. Because copied cast members must be stored in RAM, avoid 
using this command during playback in low memory situations. 

When using this method in Shockwave Player, or in the authoring environment and projectors 
with the safePl ayer property set to TRUE, a warning dialog will allow the user to cancel the 
paste operation. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement pastes the Clipboard contents into the bitmap cast member Shrine: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member! "shri ne"). pasted i pBoardInto!) 

// JavaScript syntax 

member! "shrine"). pasted i pBoard In to!);

pause() (3D) 

Usage 

member ( whi chCastmember) .model (whi chModel ). bonesPl ay er. pause!) 
member! whichCastmember) .model (whichModel ) .keyframe PI ayer.pause!) 

Description 

3D #keyf ramePl ayer and #bonesPl ayer modifier command; halts the motion currently being 
executed by the model. Use the pi ay! ) command to unpause the motion. 

When a model’s motion has been paused by using this command, the model’s 
bonesPl ayer. pi ayi ng property will be set to FALSE. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement pauses the current animation of the model named Ant3:

pause() (RealMedia, SWA, Windows Media) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. pause!) 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. pause!); 

Description 

RealMedia and Windows Media sprite or cast member method; pauses playback of the 
media stream. 

The medi aStatus value becomes #paused. 

Calling this method while the RealMedia or Windows Media stream is playing does not change 
the current!"i me property and does not clear the media buffer; this allows subsequent pi ay 
commands to resume playback without rebuffering the stream. 

Parameters 

None. 


pause!) (RealMedia, SWA, Windows Media) 443 




Example 

The following examples pause the playing of sprite 2 or the cast member Real. 

-- Lingo syntax

perpendicularTo 

Usage 

vector 1 .perpendicularTo !vector 2) 

Description 

3D vector command; returns a vector perpendicular to both the original vector and a second 
vector. This command is equivalent to the vector crossProduct command. 

Parameters 

vector2 Required. Specifies the second vector. 

Example 

In this example, posl is a vector on the x axis and pos2 is a vector on the y axis. The value 
returned by post. perpendi cul arTo! pos2) is vector! 0.0000, 0.0000, 1.00000e4 ).The 
last two lines of the example show the vector which is perpendicular to both posl and pos2. 

posl = vector(100, 0, 0) 
pos2 = vector(0, 100, 0) 
put posl.perpendicularTo!pos2) 

-- vector! 0.0000, 0.0000, 1.00000e4 )

pictureP() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
pi ctureP! picture I/a 1 ue) 

II JavaScript syntax 
pictureP! pictureVa1ue); 

Description 

Function; reports whether the state of the picture member property for the specified cast 
member is TRUE (1) or FALSE (0). 

B ecause p i c t u r e P doesn’t directly check whether a picture is associated with a cast member, you 
must test for a picture by checking the cast members picture member property. 


444 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters 


p / cture Va 1 ue Required. Specifies a reference to the picture of a cast member. 

Example 

The first statement in this example assigns the value of the pi cture member property for the 
cast member Shrine, which is a bitmap, to the variable pictureValue. The second statement 
checks whether Shrine is a picture by checking the value assigned to pictureValue. 

-- Lingo syntax 

pictureValue = member!"Shrine").picture 
put pictureP!pictureValue) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var pictureValue = member!"Shrine").picture; 
put!pictureP(pictureValue)); 

The result is 1, which is the numerical equivalent of TRUE. 

Play() (3D) 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel ).bones PI ayer. pi ay() 
member! whi chCastmember) .model (.whi chModel ). keyframe PI ayer . pi ay () 
member! whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel) .bonesPlayer.X 

pi ay (motionName {, looped, startTime, endTime, scale, offset }) 
member! whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel) .keyframe PI ayer. \ 

pi ay (motionName {, looped, startTime, endTime, scale, offset 1) 

Description 

3D #keyframePl ayer and #bonesPl ayer command; initiates or unpauses the execution 
of a motion. 

When a model’s motion has been initiated or resumed by using this command, the model’s 
bonesPl ayer. pi ay i ng property will be set to TRUE. 

Use pi ay () with no parameters to resume the execution of a motion that has been paused with 
the pause!) command. 

Using the pi ay () command to initiate a motion inserts the motion at the beginning of the 
modifier’s playlist. If this interrupts playback of another motion, the interrupted motion remains 
in the playlist in the next position after the newly initiated motion. When the newly initiated 
motion ends (if it is non-looping) or if the pi ay Next () command is issued, the interrupted 
motion will resume playback at the point where it was interrupted. 

Parameters 

moti onName Required. Specifies the name of the motion to execute. When moti onName is the 
only parameter passed to pi ay (), the motion is executed once by the model from beginning to 
end at the speed set by the modifier’s pi ay Rate property. 

looped Optional. Specifies whether the motion plays once (FALSE) or continuously (TRUE). 

startTime Optional. Measured in milliseconds from the beginning of the motion. When looped 
is TRUE, the first iteration of the loop begins at offset and ends at endT ime with all subsequent 
repetitions of the motion beginning at startTime and end at endT ime. 


play() (3D) 445 



endT ime Optional. Measured in milliseconds from the beginning of the motion. When 1 ooped is 
FALSE, the motion begins at offset and ends at endTime. When looped is TRUE, the first 
iteration of the loop begins at offset and ends at endTime with all subsequent repetitions 
beginning at start Time and end at endTime. Set endTime to-1 if you want the motion to play to 
the end. 

p 7 ayRa te Optional. Specifies the actual speed of the motion’s playback, pi ay Rate is multiplied 
by the model’s #keyframePl ayer or #bonesPl ayer modifier’s pi ay Rate property to determine 
the actual speed of the motion’s playback. 

offset Optional. Measured in milliseconds from the beginning of the motion. When 1 ooped is 
FALSE, the motion begins at offset and ends at endTime. When 7 ooped is TRUE, the first 
iteration of the loop begins at offset and ends at endTime with all subsequent repetitions 
beginning at startTime and end at cropEnd. You can alternately specify the offset parameter 
with a value of #synchroni zed in order to start the motion at the same relative position in its 
duration as the currently playing animation is through its own duration. 

Example 

This command causes the model named Walker to begin playback of the motion named Fall. 
After playing this motion, the model will resume playback of any previously playing motion. 

sprite(l).member.model("Walker").bones PIayer.pi ay("Fal1", 0, \ 

0 , -1, 1, 0) 

This command causes the model named Walker to begin playback of the motion named Kick. If 
Walker is currently executing a motion, it is interrupted by Kick and a section of Kick will play in 
a continuous loop. The first iteration of the loop will begin 2000 milliseconds from the motion's 
beginning. All subsequent iterations of the loop will begin 1000 milliseconds from Kick’s 
beginning and will end 5000 milliseconds from Kick’s beginning. The rate of playback will be 
three times the pi ay Rate property of the model’s bonesPlayer modifier.

Description 

DVD method; starts or resumes playback. 


446 Chapter 12: Methods 



Without parameters, this method resumes playback if paused, or if stopped, starts playback at the 
top of a disc or at the value specified by the startTi me Li st property. Playback continues until 
the value specified by the stopT imeLi st property, if set. 

With the beginTitie , begi nChapter, endTitie , and endChapter parameters, this method 
starts playback at a given title and chapter. Playback continues until the specified endTitle and 
endChapter parameters, if set. 

With the begi nTi me L i st and endTi me L ist parameters, this method plays from the value 
specified by the begi nTi me Li st parameter to the value specified by the endT imeL ist parameter. 

The following list formats are used for begi nTi meLi st and endTimeLi st: 

[#title:l, #chapter:l, #hours:0, #minutes:1, #seconds:l] 
or 

[#title:l, #hours:0, #minutes:l, #seconds:l] 

This method returns 0 if successful. 

Parameters 

begi nTi tl e Required if starting playback at a given title and chapter. A number that specifies the 
title that contains the chapter to play. This parameter will override the member's startT imeL ist 
property. 

begi nChapter Required if starting playback at a given title and chapter. A number that specifies 
the chapter to play. This parameter will override the member's sta rtTi meLi st property. 

endTi tl e Required if stopping playback at a given title and chapter. A number that specifies the 
title where playback will stop. This parameter will override the member's stopTi meLi st 
property. 

endChapter Required if stopping playback at a given title and chapter. A number that specifies 
the chapter to play. This parameter will override the member's stopTi meLi st property. 

begi nTi me Li st Required if starting playback at a given start time. A property list that specifies 
the time at which playback starts. This parameter will override the member's startTimeList 
property. 

endT imeLi st Required if starting playback at a given start time. A property list that specifies the 
time at which playback stops. This parameter will override the member's stopTi me Li st property. 

Example 

This statement resumes playback of a paused sprite: 

-- Lingo syntax 
member!12).pi ay() 

// JavaScript syntax 
member!12).pi ay(); 

These statements start playing at chapter 2 of title 1 and finish playing at chapter 4: 

member!15).pi ay ([#title:1, #chapter:2], [#title:l, #chapter:4]) 
or 

member!15).pi ay(1,2,1,4) 


play() (DVD) 447

play() (Sound Channel) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
soundChannelObjRef. pi ay () 
soundChannelObjRef. pi a y(memberObjRef) 
soundChannelObjRef. pi ay( prop List) 

II JavaScript syntax 
soundChannelObjRef .pi ay(); 
soundChannel ObjRef. pi a y(memberObjRef ); 
soundChannelObjRef .pi a yipropLi st); 

Description 

Sound Channel method; begins playing any sounds queued in a sound channel, or queues and 
begins playing a given cast member. 

Sound cast members take some time to load into RAM before they can begin playback. It’s 
recommended that you queue sounds with queue () before you want to begin playing them and 
then use the first form of this method. The second two forms do not take advantage of the pre- 
loading accomplished with the queue! ) command. 

By using an optional property list, you can specify exact playback settings for a sound. 

To see an example of pi ay () used in a completed movie, see the Sound Control movie in the 
Learning/Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters 

memberObjRef Required if playing a specific cast member. A reference to the cast member object 
to queue and play. 

prop Li s t Required if specifying playback settings for a sound. A property list that specifies the 
exact playback settings for the sound. These properties may be optionally set: 


Property Description 


#member 


#startTime 


//endTime 


The sound cast member to queue. This property must be provided; all others are 
optional. 

The time within the sound at which playback begins, in milliseconds. The default is 
the beginning of the sound. See startTime. 

The time within the sound at which playback ends, in milliseconds. The default is 
the end of the sound. See endTime. 


//loopCount The number of times to play a loop defined with #1 oopStartTime and 
#1 oopEndTime. The default is 1. See loopCount. 

#1 oopStartTime The time within the sound to begin a loop, in milliseconds. See 1 oopStartTime. 


448 Chapter 12: Methods 







Property Description 

#1 oopEndTi me The time within the sound to end a loop, in milliseconds. See 1 oopEndT i me. 

#prel oadTime The amount of the sound to buffer before playback, in milliseconds. See 
preloadTime. 


Example 

This statement plays cast member introMusic in sound channel 1: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sound(1).pi ay(member("introMusic")) 

// JavaScript syntax 

sound(l).play(member("introMusic")); 

The following statement plays cast member creditsMusic in sound channel 2. Playback begins 4 
seconds into the sound and ends 15 seconds into the sound. The section from 10.5 seconds to 14 
seconds loops 6 times. 

-- Lingo syntax 

sound(2).play([#member:member("creditsMusic"), #startTime:4000, \ 

#endTime:15000, #1oopCount:6, #loopStartTime:10500, #1oopEndTime:14000]) 

// JavaScript syntax

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
windowsMediaObjRef. pi ay () 
rea 1 Medi aObjRef. pi ay() 

// JavaScript syntax 
windowsMediaObjRef. pi ay(); 
real Medi aObjRef. pi ay(); 

Description 

Windows Media or RealMedia cast member or sprite method; plays the Windows Media or 
RealMedia cast member or plays the sprite on the Stage. 

For cast members, only audio is rendered if present in the movie. If the cast member is already 
playing, calling this method has no effect. 

Parameters 

None. 


play() (RealMedia, SWA, Windows Media) 449 












Example 

The following examples start the streaming process for the stream in sprite 2 and the cast 
member Real.

playFile() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

soundChannelObjRef .pi ayFi 1 e( stringFi1ePath) 

// JavaScript syntax 

soundChannelObjRef .pi ayFi 1 e( stringFi1ePath); 

Description 

Sound Channel method; plays the AIFF, SWA, AU, or WAV sound in a sound channel. 

For the sound to be played properly, the correct MIX Xtra must be available to the movie, usually 
in the Xtras folder of the application. 

When the sound file is in a different folder than the movie, stringFi 1 ePath must specify the full 
path to the file. 

To play sounds obtained from a URL, it’s usually a good idea to use downl oadNetThi ng() or 
prel oadNetThi ng() to download the file to a local disk first. This approach can minimize 
problems that may occur while the file is downloading. 

The pi ay Fi 1 e() method streams files from disk rather than playing them from RAM. As 
a result, using p 1 ay Fi 1 e () when playing digital video or when loading cast members into 
memory can cause conflicts when the computer tries to read the disk in two places at once. 

Parameters 

stri ngFi 1 ePath Required. A string that specifies the name of the file to play. When the sound 
file is in a different folder than the currently playing movie, stringFi 1 ePath must also specify 
the full path to the file. 

Example 

This statement plays the file named Thunder in channel 1: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sound!1).piayFi1e("Thunder.wav") 

// JavaScript syntax 

sound(l).pi ayFile!"Thunder.wav"); 


450 Chapter 12: Methods 



This statement plays the file named Thunder in channel 3: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sound(3).piayFi1e(_movie.path & "Thunder.wav") 

// JavaScript syntax 

sound(3).piayFi1e(_movie.path + "Thunder.wav");

Description 

Windows Media sprite method. Starts playback from a specified start time and plays to a specified 
end time. 

Parameters 

intStartTime Required. An integer that specifies the time, in milliseconds, at which playback 
begins. 

intEndTime Required. An integer that specifies the time, in milliseconds, at which playback ends. 

Example 

This statement specifies that the sprite named Video should play from the 30 second mark to the 
40 second mark. 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite("Video").pi ayFromToTime(30000, 40000)

playNext() (3D) 

Usage 

member( whichMember ).model ( whichModel ).bones PI ayer.pi ayNext() 
member( whichMember ).model ( whichModel ).keyframe PI ayer.pl ayNext() 

Description 

3D #keyframePl ayer and #bonesPl ayer modifier command; initiates playback of the next 
motion in the playlist of the model’s #keyf ramePl ayer or #bonesPl ayer modifier. The 
currently playing motion, which is the first entry in the playlist, is interrupted and removed from 
the playlist. 

If motion blending is enabled, and there are two or more motions in the playlist, blending 
between the current motion and the next one in the playlist will begin when pi ayNext () 
is called. 

Example 

This statement interrupts the motion currently being executed by model 1 and initiates playback 
of the next motion in the playlist: 

member("scene").model[1].bones PIayer.piaynext()

point() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
point! intH, int /) 

// JavaScript syntax 
point( intH, inti ); 

Description 

Top level function and data type. Returns a point that has specified horizontal and 
vertical coordinates. 

A point has both a 1 ocH and a 1 ocV property. 

Point coordinates can be changed by arithmetic operations using Lingo only. For example, the 
following two points can be added together using Lingo, but NaN is returned using JavaScript 
syntax: 

-- Lingo 

pointA = point(10,10) 
pointB = point(5,5) 
put(pointA + pointB) 

-- point(15,15) 

// JavaScript syntax 
var pointA = point(10,10); 
var pointB = point(5,5); 
tracefpointA + pointB); 

// NaN 

To see an example of poi nt () used in a completed movie, see the Imaging and Vector Shapes 
movies in the Learning/Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters 

intH Required. An integer that specifies the horizontal coordinate of the point. 
intV Required. An integer that specifies the vertical coordinate of the point. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable 1 astLocati on to the point (250, 400): 

-- Lingo syntax 

lastLocation = point(250, 400) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var lastLocation = point(250, 400); 


point() 453 





This statement adds 5 pixels to the horizontal coordinate of the point assigned to the variable 
myPoi nt: 

-- Lingo syntax 

myPoint.locH = myPoint.locH + 5 

// JavaScript syntax 
myPoint.locH = myPoint.locH + 5; 

In Lingo only, the following statements set a sprite’s Stage coordinates to mouseH and mouseV plus 
10 pixels. The two statements are equivalent. 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(_mouse.clickOn). 1 oc = point(_mouse.mouseH, _mouse.mouseV) \ 

+ point(10, 10) 

sprite(_mouse.clickOn).1oc = _mouse.mouseLoc + 10

point At 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .model (whi chModel) .pointAtX 
( vectorPosition{, vectorUp 1) 
member! whichCastmember) .camera! whichCamera) .poi ntAtX 
{vectorPosition{, vectorUp )) 
member! whichCastmember). 1 i ght! whichLight) . poi ntAtX 
{vectorPosition{ , vectorUp )) 
member! whichCastmember) . group! whichGroup) . poi ntAtX 
{vectorPosition{, vectorUp )) 

Description 

3D command; rotates the referenced object so that its forward direction vector points at a 
specified world relative position, then it rotates the referenced object to point it’s up direction 
vector in the direction hinted at by a specified relative vector. 

The object’s front and up direction vectors are defined by the object’s poi ntAtOri entati on 
property. 

Parameters 

vectorPosi ti on Required. Specifies the world relative position. This value can also be a 
node reference. 

vectorUp Optional. Specfies a world relative vector that hints at where the object’s up vector 
should point. If this parameter isn’t specified, then poi ntAt defaults to using the world’s y axis as 
the up hinting vector. If you attempt to point the object at a position such that the object’s 
forward vector is parallel to the world’s y axis, then the world’s x axis is used as the up 
hinting vector. The direction at which you wish to point the object’s forward direction and the 
direction specified by vectorUp do not need to be perpendicular to each other being as this 
command only uses the vectorUp parameter as a hinting vector. 


454 Chapter 12: Methods 



Example 


This example points three objects at the model named Mars: the camera named MarsCam, the 
light named BrightSpot, and the model named BigGun: 

thisWorldPosn = member(“Scene”).model(“Mars”).worl dPosi ti on 
member("Scene").camera("MarsCam").pointAt(thisWorldPosn) 
member("Scene").1ight("BrightSpot").pointAt(thisWorldPosn) 
member!"Scene").model("BigGun").pointAt(thisWorldPosn, \ 
vector(0,0,45)) 

If you use non-uniform scaling and a custom poi ntAtOri entati on on the same node, e.g., a 
model, using poi ntAt will likely cause unexpected non-uniform scaling. This is due to the order 
in which the non-uniform scaling and the rotation to properly orient the node are applied. To 
workaround this issue, do one of the following: 

• Avoid using non-uniform scaling and non-default poi ntAtOri entati on together on the 
same node. 

• Remove your scale prior to using poi ntAt, and then reapply it afterwards. 

For example: 

scale = node.transform.scale 
node.scale = vector( 1,1,1) 

node.pointAt(vector(0, 0, 0)) -- non-default pointAtOrientation 
node.transform.scale = scale

pointlnHyperlink() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri teObjRef. poi ntlnHyperl i nk(point) 

// JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. poi ntlnHyperl i nk (.point) ; 

Description 

Text sprite function; returns a value (TRUE or FALSE) that indicates whether the specified point is 
within a hyperlink in the text sprite. Typically, the point used is the cursor position. This is useful

postNetText 

Usage 

postNetText! url, propertyList {, serverOSString\ {, serverCharSetString}) 
postNetText( ur 1, postText {, serverOSString) l.serverCharSetString}) 

Description 

Command; sends a POST request to a URL, which is an HTTP URL, with specified data. 

This command is similar to getNetText! ). As with getNetText( ), the server’s response is 
returned by netTextResul t( netID) once netDone( netID) becomes l,and if 
netError( netID ) is 0, or okay. 

The optional parameters may be omitted without regard to position. 

This command also has an additional advantage over getNetText! ): a postNetText! ) query 
can be arbitrarily long, whereas the getNetT ext () query is limited to the length of a URL (IK or 
4K, depending on the browser). 

Note: If you use postNetText to post data to a domain different from the one the movie is playing 
from, the movie will display a security alert when playing back in Shockwave Player. 

To see an example of postNetText used in a completed movie, see the Forms and Post movie in 
the Learning/Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters 

url Required. Specifies the URL to send the POST request to. 

propertyListOrPostText Required. Specifies the data to send with the request. When a 
property list is used instead of a string, the information is sent in the same way a browser posts an 
HTML form, with METH0D=P0ST. This facilitates the construction and posting of form data 
within a Director title. Property names correspond to HTML form field names and property 
values to field values. 

The property list can use either strings or symbols as the property names. If a symbol is used, it is 
automatically converted to a string without the # at the beginning. Similarly, a numeric value is 
converted to a string when used as the value of a property. 

Note: If a program uses the alternate form-a string instead of property list-the string postText is sent 
to the server as an HTTP POST request using MIME type “text/plain.” This will be convenient for 
some applications, but is not compatible with HTML forms posting. 

serverOSStri ng Optional. Defaults to UNIX but may be set to Wi ndows or Mac and translates 
any carriage returns in the postText argument into those used on the server to avoid confusion. 
For most applications, this setting is unnecessary because line breaks are usually not used in 
form responses. 

serverCha rSetStri ng Optional. Applies only if the user is running on a Shift-JIS (Japanese) 
system. Its possible settings are " J IS", "EUC", "ASCI I ", and "AUTO". Posted data is converted 
from Shift-JIS to the named character set. Returned data is handled exactly as by getNetText () 
(converted from the named character set to Shift-JIS). If you use "AUTO", the posted data from 
the local character set is not translated; the results sent back by the server are translated as they are 
for getNetText! ). "ASCI I " is the default if serverCharSetString is omitted. "ASCI I" 
provides no translation for posting or results. 


postNetText 461 



Example 

This statement omits the serverCharSetString parameter: 

netID = postNetText! "www. myeloma in . com\database . cgi", "Bill Jones”, "Win”) 

This example generates a form from user-entry fields for first and last name, along with a Score. 
Both serverOSString and serverCharSetStringhave been omitted: 

lastName = member("Last Name").text 
firstName = member!"First Name").text 
totalScore = member!"Current Score").text 

infoList = ["FName":firstName, "LName":1astName, "Score"Total Score] 
netID = postNetText! "www. myeloma in . com\userbase . cgi", infoList)

Parameters 

base Required. Specifies the base number. 
exponent Required. Specifies the exponent value. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable vResul t to the value of 4 to the third power:

prel_oadMovie() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.preLoadMovie( stringMovieName) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.preLoadMovie( stringMovieName ); 

Description 

Movie method; preloads the data and cast members associated with the first frame of the specified 
movie. Preloading a movie helps it start faster when it is started by the go () or pi ay C) methods. 

To preload cast members from a U RL, usepreloadNetThingO to load the cast members directly 
into the cache, or use downl oadNetThi ng() to load a movie on a local disk from which you can 
load the movie into memory and minimize downloading time. 

Parameters 

stri ngMovi eName Required. A string that specifies the name of the movie to preload. 

Example 

This statement preloads the movie Introduction, which is located in the same folder as the 
current movie: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.preLoadMovie("Introduction") 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.preLoadMovie("Introduction");

downloadNetThing , go() , Movie, preloadNetThingi) 

preloadNetThing() 

Usage 

preloadNetThing iurl) 

Description 

Function; preloads a file from the Internet to the local cache so it can be used later without a 
download delay. The return value is a network ID that you can use to monitor the progress of 
the operation. 

The preloadNetThingO function downloads the file while the current movie continues playing. 
Use netDone() to find out whether downloading is finished. 

After an item is downloaded, it can be displayed immediately because it is taken from the local 
cache rather than from the network. 

Although many network operations can be active at a time, running more than four concurrent 
operations usually slows down performance unacceptably. 

Neither the cache size nor the Check Documents option in a browsers preferences affects the 
behavior of the prel oadNetThi ng function. 


466 Chapter 12: Methods 



The prel oadNetThi ng() function does not parse a Director file’s links. Thus, even if a Director 
file is linked to casts and graphic files, preloadNetThing!) downloads only the Director file. You 
still must preload other linked objects separately. 

Parameters 

ur 1 Required. Specifies the name of any valid Internet file, such as a Director movie, graphic, or 
FTP server location. 

Example 

This statement uses prel oadNetThi ng() and returns the network ID for the operation: 

set mynetid = preloadNetThing("http://www.yourserver.com/menupage/ 
mymovie.dir") 

After downloading is complete, you can navigate to the movie using the same URL. The movie 
will be played from the cache instead of the URL, since it’s been loaded in the cache.

preMultiply 

Usage 

transforml .preMul ti piy ( transform2) 

Description 

3D transform command; alters a transform by pre-applying the positional, rotational, and scaling 
effects of another transform. 

If transform2 describes a rotation of 90° about the X axis and transforml describes a 
translation of 100 units in the Y axis, transforml. multiply! transform2 ) will alter this 
transform so that it describes a translation followed by a rotation. The statement 
transforml. preMul ti piy ( transform2 ) will alter this transform so that it describes a rotation 
followed by a translation. The effect is that the order of operations is reversed. 

Parameters 

transform2 Required. Specifies the transform from which effects are pre-applied to another 
transform. 

Example 

This statement performs a calculation that applies the transform of the model Mars to the 
transform of the model Pluto: 

member!"scene").model("Pluto").transform.preMultiply\ 

(member!"scene").model ("Mars").transform) 


preMultiply 467 



preRotate 

Usage 

transformReference. preRotate( xAngle, yAngle, zAngle ) 
transformReference. preRotate( vector ) 

transformReference. preRotate( positionVector , directionVector, \ 
angle ) 

member! whichCastmember ) .node. transform.preRotate( xAngle, \ 
yAngle, zAngle ) 

member! whichCastmember ) .node. transform.preRotate! vector ) 
member! whichCastmember ).node. transform . preRotateX 
( positionVector , directionVector, angle ) 

Description 

3D transform command; applies a rotation before the current positional, rotational, and scale 
offsets held by the referenced transform object. The rotation may be specified as a set of three 
angles, each of which specify an angle of rotation about the three corresponding axes. These 
angles may be specified explicitly in the form of xAngl e, yAngl e, and zAngl e, or by a vector, 
where the x component of the vector corresponds to the rotation about the x-axis, the y about the 
y-axis, and the z about the z-axis. 

Alternatively, the rotation may also be specified as a rotation about an arbitrary axis. This axis is 
defined in space by posi ti onVector and di recti onVector. The amount of rotation about this 
axis is specified by angle. 

Node may be a reference to a model, group, light, or camera 

Parameters 

xAngl e Required if applying a rotation using x-, y-, and z-axes. Specifies the angle of rotation 
around the x-axis. 

yAngle Required if applying a rotation using x-, y-, and z-axes. Specifies the angle of rotation 
around the y-axis. 

zAngle Required if applying a rotation using x-, y-, and z-axes. Specifies the angle of rotation 
around the z-axis. 

vector Required if applying a rotation using a vector. Specifies the vector whose angles are used 
in the rotation. 

posi ti onVector Required if applying a rotation about an arbitrary axis. Specifies the 
position offset. 

di recti on Vector Required if applying a rotation about an arbitrary axis. Specifies the 
direction offset. 

ang 1 e Required if applying a rotation about an arbitrary axis. Specifies the amount of rotation 
about an arbitrary axis. 

Example 

The following statement performs a rotation of20° about each axis. Since the model’s transform 
property is its position, rotation, and scale offsets relative to that model’s parent, and preRotate 
applies the change in orientation prior to any existing effects of that model's transform, this will 
rotate the model in place rather than orbiting around its parent. 

member!"scene").model("bipOl").transform.preRotate!20, 20, 20) 


468 Chapter 12: Methods 



The above is equivalent to: 

member("scene").model("bip01").rotate(20,20,20). 

Generally preRotateO is only useful when dealing with transform variables. This line will orbit 
the camera about the point (100, 0, 0) in space, around the y axis, by 180°. 

t = transform!) 

t.position = member!"scene").camera[1].transform.position 
t. preRotate!vector!100, 0, 0), vector(0, 1, 0), 180) 
member("scene").camera[1].transform = t

preScale() 

Usage 

transformReference. preScale! xScale, yScale, zScale ) 
transformReference. preScale! vector ) 

member! whichCastmember ) .node. transform.preScale! xScale, \ 
yScale, zScale ) 

member! whichCastmember ) .node. transform.preScale! vector ) 

Description 

3D transform command; applies a scale prior to the existing positional, rotational, and scaling 
effects of the given transform. 

Node may be a reference to a model, group, light, or camera. 

Parameters 

xSca 1 e Required if applying a scale using x-, y-, and z-axes. Specifies the scale around the x-axis. 

yScale Required if applying a scale using x-, y-, and z-axes. Specifies the scale around the y-axis. 

zScale Required if applying a scale using x-, y-, and z-axes. Specifies the scale around the z-axis. 

vector Required if applying a scale using a vector. Specifies the vector that contains the scale 

to apply. 

Example 

Line 1 of the following Lingo creates a duplicate of Moonl’s transform. Remember that access to 
a model’s transform property is by reference. 

Line 2 applies a scale to that transform prior to any existing positional or rotational effects of that 
transform. Assume that the transform represents the positional offset and rotational orbit of 
Moonl relative to its parent planet. Lets also assume Moon2’s parent is the same as Moonl’s. If 
we used scale! ) here instead of preScale!), then Moon2 would be pushed out twice as far and 
rotated about the planet twice as much as is Moonl. This is because the scaling would be applied 
to the transform’s existing positional and rotational offsets. Using preScal e( ) will apply the size 
change without affecting these existing positional and rotational offsets. 

Line 3 applies an additional 180° rotation about the x-axis of the planet. This will put Moon2 on 
the opposite side of Moonl’s orbit. Using preRotate!) would have left Moon2 in the same place 
as Moonl, spun around its own x-axis by 180°. 


preScale!) 469 



Line 4 assigns this new transform to Moon2. 

t = member("scene").model("Moonl").transform.duplicate() 
t.preScale(2,2,2) 
t.rotate)180,0,0) 

member)"scene").model("Moon2").transform = t 

preTranslate() 

Usage 

transformReference .preTransl ate( xlncrement, ylncrement, \ 
zlncrement ) 

transformReference .preTransl ate( vector ) 

member) whichCastmember ). node. transform.preTranslate\ 

(xlncrement , ylncrement , zlncrement) 
member) whichCastmember ). node. transform.preTranslate) vector ) 

Description 

3D transform command; applies a translation before the current positional, rotational, and scale 
offsets held by the referenced transform object. The translation may be specified as a set of three 
increments along the three corresponding axes. These increments may be specified explicitly in 
the form of xlncrement, ylncrement, and zlncrement, or by a vector, where the X component 
of the vector corresponds to the translation about the X axis, the Y about the Y axis, and the Z 
about the Z axis. 

After a series of transformations are done, in the following order, the model’s local origin will be at 
(0, 0, -100), assuming the model’s parent is the world: 

model.transform.identity() 

model.transform.rotate(0, 90, 0) 

model.transform.preTranslate)100, 0, 0) 

Had transl ate)) been used instead of preTransl ate)), the model's local origin would be at 
(100, 0, 0) and the model rotated about its own Y axis by 90°. The statement 
model . transform, pretransl ate(x, y, z) is equivalent to model .transl ate(x, y, z). 
Generally, preTranslate)) is only useful when dealing with transform variables rather than

print() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri teObjRef. pri nt( I targetName, iipri nti ngBounds) ) 

// JavaScript syntax 

spriteObjRef. print(I targetName, iipri nti ngBounds ) ); 

Description 

Command; calls the corresponding print ActionScript command, which was introduced in 
Flash 5. All frames in the Flash movie that have been labeled #p are printed. If no individual 
frames have been labeled, the whole movie prints. 

Because printing of Flash movies is rather complicated, you may benefit from reviewing the 
section about printing in the Flash 5 documentation before using this sprite function. 

Parameters 

targetName Optional. Specifies the name of the target movie or movie clip to be printed. If 
omitted (if the target is 0), then the main Flash movie is printed. 

pri nti ngBounds Optional. Specifies the options for the printing bounds. If omitted, the bounds 
of the target movie are used. If specified, pri nti ngBounds must be one of the following values: 

• #bf rame. If specified, then the printing bounds for each page are changed to match each frame 
that is being printed. 

• #bmax. If specified, then the printing bounds become a large enough virtual rectangle to fit all 
frames to be printed. 


printAsBitmapO 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri teObjRef. pri ntAsBi tmap( { targetName, iipri nti ngBounds ]) 

// JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. pri ntAsBi tmap( { targetName, iipri nti ngBounds ]); 

Description 

Flash sprite command; functions much like the print command, but works only with 
Flash sprites. Fiowever, pri ntAsBi tmap can be used to print objects containing alpha 
channel information. 


printAsBitmapO 471 



printFrom() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.printFrom (startFrameNameOrNum {, endFrameNameOrNum, redux }) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.printFrom (startFrameNameOrNum {, endFrameNameOrNum, redux}); 

Description 

Movie method; prints whatever is displayed on the Stage in each frame, whether or not the frame 
is selected, starting at the frame specified by startFrame. Optionally, you can supply endFrame 
and a reduction (redux) value (100%, 50%, or 25%). 

The frame being printed need not be currently displayed. This command always prints at 72 dots 
per inch (dpi), bitmaps everything on the screen (text will not be as smooth in some cases), prints 
in portrait (vertical) orientation, and ignores Page Setup settings. For more flexibility when 
printing from within Director, see PrintOMatic Lite Xtra, which is on the installation disk. 

Parameters 

StartFrameNameOrNum Required. A string or integer that specifies the name or number of the 
first frame to print. 

endFrameNameOrNum Optional. A string or integer that specifies the name or number of the last 
frame to print. 

redux Optional. An integer that specifies the reduction value. Valid values are 100, 50, or 25. 

Example 

This statement prints what is on the Stage in frame 1: 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.printFrom(l) 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.printFrom(l); 

The following statement prints what is on the Stage in every frame from frame 10 to frame 25. 
The reduction is 50%. 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.printFrom( 10, 25, 50) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.printFrom( 10, 25, 50);

litsywbol 1: val uel, ^symbol 2: val ue2, ...] 

// JavaScript syntax 
propList(); 

propList (.stringl, valuel, string2, value2, ...); 

Description 

Top level function; creates a property list, where each element in the list consists of a name/value 
pair. 

When creating a property list using the syntax propLi st() or [: ] (Lingo only), with or without 
parameters, the index of list values begins with 1. 

The maximum length of a single line of executable script is 256 characters. Large property lists 
cannot be created using p r o p L i s t (). To create a property list with a large amount of data, 
enclose the data in square brackets ([ ]), put the data into a field, and then assign the field to a 
variable. The variable’s content is a list of the data. 

Parameters 

stringl, string2, . . . Optional. Strings that specify the name portions of the elements in 
the list. 

va 1 uel, va 1 ue2, . . . Optional. Values that specify the value portions of the elements in the list. 

(/symbol 1, ttsymbol2, . . . (Lingo only) Optional. Symbols that represent the name portions of 
the elements in the list. 

Example 

This statement creates a property list with various properties and values, and then displays the 
various property values in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
-- using propList!) 

colorList = propList(#top, "red", #si des , "bl ue", (/bottom, "green") 

-- using brackets 

colorList = [(/top: "red", (/sides : "bl ue", (/bottom: "green" ] 
put(colorList.top) -- "red"

Description 

Command; sets the values of an FTP or HTTP proxy server. 

Without parameters, proxyServer! ) returns the settings of an FTP or HTTP proxy server. 

Parameters 

serverType Optional. A symbol that specifies the type of proxy server. The value can be either 
#ftp or #http. 

ipAddress Optional. A string that specifies the IP address. 
portNum Optional. An integer that specifies the port number. 

Example 

This statement sets up an HTTP proxy server at IP address 197.65.208.157 using port 5: 

proxyServer #http,"197.65.208.157",5 

This statement returns the port number of an HTTP proxy server: 

put proxyServer(#http,#port) 

If no server type is specified, the function returns 1. 

This statement returns the IP address string of an HTTP proxy server: 
put proxyServer(#http) 

This statement turns off an FTP proxy server: 
proxyServer #ftp,#stop 

ptToHotSpotlD() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax

puppetPalette() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.puppetPalette(pa7ette {, speed ) {, frames }) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.puppetPalette(pa7ette {, speed ) {, frames}); 

Description 

Movie method; causes the palette channel to act as a puppet and lets script override the palette 
setting in the palette channel of the Score and assign palettes to the movie. 

The puppetPal ette( ) method sets the current palette to the palette cast member specified by 
pa 1 ette. If palette evaluates to a string, it specifies the cast library name of the palette. If 
palette evaluates to an integer, it specifies the member number of the palette. 

For best results, use the puppetPal ette( ) method before navigating to the frame on which the 
effect will occur so that Director can map to the desired palette before drawing the next frame. 

You can fade in the palette by replacing speed with an integer from 1 (slowest) to 60 (fastest). You 
can also fade in the palette over several frames by replacing frames with an integer for the 
number of frames. 

A puppet palette remains in effect until you turn it off using the syntax 

_movie.puppetPalette(0). No subsequent palette changes in the Score are obeyed when the 
puppet palette is in effect. 

Note: The browser controls the palette for the entire Web page. Thus, Shockwave Player always 
uses the browser's palette. 

Parameters 

palette Required. A string or integer that specifies the name or number of the new palette. 
speed Optional. An integer that specifies the speed of a fade. Valid values range from 1 to 60. 
frames Optional. An integer that specifies the number of frames over which a fade takes place. 

Example 

This statement makes Rainbow the movie’s palette: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.puppetPalette("Rainbow") 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.puppetPalette("Rainbow"); 

The following statement makes Grayscale the movie’s palette. The transition to the Grayscale 
palette occurs over a time setting of 15, and over 20 frames. 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.puppetPalette("Rainbow", 15, 20) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.puppetPalette("Rainbow", 15, 20);

puppetPaletteQ 475 




puppetSprite() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.puppetSprite( intSpriteNum, bool ) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.puppetSprite( intSpriteNum, bool ); 

Description 

Movie method; determines whether a sprite channel is a puppet and under script control (TRUE) 
or not a puppet and under the control of the Score (FALSE). 

While the playhead is in the same sprite, turning off the sprite channel’s puppetting using the 
syntax puppetSpri te( i ntSpri teNum , FALSE) resets the sprite’s properties to those in the Score. 

The sprite channel’s initial properties are whatever the channel’s settings are when the 
puppetSpri te( ) method is executed. You can use script to change sprite properties as follows: 

• If a sprite channel is a puppet, any changes that script makes to the channel’s sprite properties 
remain in effect after the playhead exits the sprite. 

• If a sprite channel is not a puppet, any changes that script makes to a sprite last for the life of 
the current sprite only. 

The channel must contain a sprite when you use the puppetSpri te( ) method. 

Making the sprite channel a puppet lets you control many sprite properties—such as member, 

1 ocH, and wi dth —from script after the playhead exits the sprite. 

Use the syntax puppetSpri te( 1 ntSpri teNum, FALSE) to return control to the Score when you 
finish controlling a sprite channel from script and to avoid unpredictable results that may occur 
when the playhead is in frames that aren’t intended to be puppets. 

Note: Version 6 of Director introduced autopuppetting, which made it unnecessary to explicitly 
puppet a sprite under most circumstances. Explicit control is still useful if you want to retain complete 
control over a channel's contents even after a sprite span has finished playing. 

Parameters 

7 ntSpri teNum Required. An integer that specifies the sprite channel to test. 

boo 1 Required. A boolean value that specifies whether a sprite channel is under script control 
(TRUE) or under the control of the Score (FALSE). 

Example 

This statement makes the sprite in channel 15a puppet: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.puppetSprite(15, TRUE) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.puppetSprite(15, true); 


476 Chapter 12: Methods 



This statement removes the puppet condition from the sprite in the channel numbered i + 1: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.puppetSprite(i + 1, FALSE) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.puppetSprite(i + 1, false);

makeScriptedSprite() , Movie, Sprite Channel 

puppetTempo() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.puppetTempol IntTempo) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.puppetTempol IntTempo) ; 

Description 

Movie method; causes the tempo channel to act as a puppet and sets the tempo to a specified 
number of frames. 

When the tempo channel is a puppet, script can override the tempo setting in the Score and 
change the tempo assigned to the movie. 

It’s unnecessary to turn off the puppet tempo condition to make subsequent tempo changes in the 
Score take effect. 

Note: Although it is theoretically possible to achieve frame rates up to 30,000 frames per second 
(fps) with the puppetTempot) method, you could do this only with little animation and a very powerful 
machine. 

Parameters 

intTempo Required. An integer that specifies the tempo. 

Example 

This statement sets the movie’s tempo to 30 fps: 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.puppetTempo(30) 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.puppetTempo(30); 

This statement increases the movie’s old tempo by 10 fps: 

-- Lingo syntax

puppetT ransition() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.puppetTransition( member ObjRef) 

_movie.puppetTransition( int j, time ) {, sizel {, areal) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.puppetT ransition (memberObjRef); 

_movie.puppetTransition( int {, time I {, sizel {, areal); 

Description 

Movie method; performs the specified transition between the current frame and the next frame. 

To use an Xtra transition cast member, use the puppetT ransi ti on (memberObjRef) syntax. 

To use a built-in Director transition, replace int with a value in the following table. Replace time 
with the number of quarter seconds used to complete the transition. The minimum value is 0; the 
maximum is 120 (30 seconds). Replace s ize with the number of pixels in each chunk of the 
transition. The minimum value is 1; the maximum is 128. Smaller chunk sizes yield smoother 
transitions but are slower.

Transitions marked with an asterisk (*) do not work on monitors set to 32 bits. 

There is no direct relationship between a low time value and a fast transition. The actual speed of 
the transition depends on the relation of size and time. For example, if size is 1 pixel, the 
transition takes longer no matter how low the time value, because the computer has to do a lot of 
work. To make transitions occur faster, use a larger chunk size, not a shorter time. 

Replace area with a value that determines whether the transition occurs only in the changing area 
(TRUE) or over the entire Stage (FALSE, default). The area variable is an area within which sprites 
have changed. 

Parameters 

memberObj Ref Required if using an Xtra transition cast member. A reference to the Xtra cast 
member to use as the transition. 

int Required if using a built-in Director transition. An integer that specifies the number of the 
transition to use. 

t ime Optional. An integer that specifies that number of quarter seconds used to complete the 
transition. Valid values range from 0 to 120. 

size Optional. An integer that specifies the number of pixels in each chunk of the transition. 
Valid values range from 1 to 128. 

area Optional. A boolean value that specifies whether the transition occurs only in the changing 
area (TRUE) or over the entire Stage (FALSE). 

Example 

The following statement performs a wipe right transition. Because no value is specified for area, 
the transition occurs over the entire Stage, which is the default.

_movie.puppetT ransition(1) 

// JavaScript syntax

Description 

Sound Channel method; adds a sound cast member to the queue of a sound channel. 


queue!) 481 



Once a sound has been queued, it can be played immediately with the pi ay () method. This is 
because Director preloads a certain amount of each sound that is queued, preventing any delay 
between the pi ay () method and the start of playback. The default amount of sound that is 
preloaded is 1500 milliseconds. This parameter can be modified by passing a property list 
containing one or more parameters with the queue () method. These parameters can also be 
passed with the setPl ayLi st() method. 

To see an example of queue () used in a completed movie, see the Sound Control movie in the 
Learning/Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters 

memberObj Ref Required if specifying a sound cast member. A reference to the sound cast 
member to queue. 

propL ist Required if passing a property list as parameters. A property list that applies to the 
sound cast member to queue. These properties include: 


Property Description 


//member The sound cast member to queue. This property must be provided; all others 

are optional. 

//startTime The time within the sound at which playback begins, in milliseconds. The default is 
the beginning of the sound. See startTime. 

//endTime The time within the sound at which playback ends, in milliseconds. The default is 

the end of the sound. See endTime. 

#1 oopCount The number of times to play a loop defined with #1 oopStartTime and #1 oop EndTime. 

The default is 1. See 1 oopCount. 


#1 oopStartTime The time within the sound to begin a loop, in milliseconds. See 1 oopStartTime. 

#1 oopEndT i me The time within the sound to end a loop, in milliseconds. See 1 oopEndT i me. 

#prel oadTime The amount of the sound to buffer before playback, in milliseconds. See 
prel oadTime. 


Example 

The following handler queues and plays two sounds. The first sound, cast member Chimes, 
is played in its entirety. The second sound, cast member introMusic, is played starting at its 
3-second point, with a loop repeated 5 times from the 8-second point to the 8.9 second point, 
and stopping at the 10-second point.

queueimotionName {, looped, startTime, endTime, scale, offset }) 

Description 

3D keyf ramePl ayer and bonesPl ayer modifier command; adds a specified motion to the end 
of the modifiers pi ay Li st property. The motion is executed by the model when all the motions 
ahead of it in the playlist are finished playing. 

Parameters 

moti onName Required. Specifies the name of the motion to add. 

looped Optional. Specifies whether the motion plays once (FALSE) or continuously (TRUE). 

startTime Optional. Measured in milliseconds from the beginning of the motion. When looped 
is FALSE, the motion begins at offset and ends at endTime. When looped is TRUE, the first 
iteration of the loop begins at offset and ends at endTime. All subsequent repetitions begin at 
startTime and end at endTime. 

endT ime Optional. Measured in milliseconds from the beginning of the motion. When 1 ooped 
is FALSE, the motion begins at offset and ends at endTime. When looped is TRUE, the first 
iteration of the loop begins at offset and ends at endTime. All subsequent repetitions begin at 
cropStart and end at endTime. Set endTime to -1 if you want the motion to play to the end. 

scale Optional. Specifies the actual speed of the motion’s playback, seal e is multiplied by the 
pi ayRate property of the model’s #keyf ramePl ayer modifier or (/bonesPl ayer modifier to 
determine the actual speed of the motion’s playback. 

offset Optional. Measured in milliseconds from the beginning of the motion. When 1 ooped is 
FALSE, the motion begins at offset and ends at endTime. When looped is TRUE, the first 
iteration of the loop begins at offset and ends at endTime. All subsequent repetitions begin at 
startTime and end at endTime. 

Example 

The following Lingo adds the motion named Fall to the end of the bonesPl ayer playlist of the 
model named Walker. When all motions before Fall in the playlist have been executed, Fall will 
play one time from beginning to end. 

sprite(1).member.model!"Walker").bonesPlayer.queue\

queue() (3D) 483 





The following Lingo adds the motion named Kick to the end of the bonesPl ayer playlist of the 
model named Walker. When all motions before Kick in the playlist have been executed, a section 
of Kick will play in a continuous loop. The first iteration of the loop will begin 2000 milliseconds 
from the motion’s beginning. All subsequent iterations of the loop will begin 1000 milliseconds 
from Kick’s beginning and will end 5000 milliseconds from Kick’s beginning. The rate of 
playback will be three times the pi ayRate property of the model’s bonesPl ayer modifier.

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.ramNeededi 1ntFromFrame, intToFrame) 

II JavaScript syntax 

_movie.ramNeededi 7 ntFromFrame, intToFrame ): 

Description 

Movie method; determines the memory needed, in bytes, to display a range of frames. For 
example, you can test the size of frames containing 32-bit artwork: if ramNeeded ( ) is larger than 
f reeBytes (), then go to frames containing 8-bit artwork and divide by 1024 to convert bytes to 
kilobytes (K). 

Parameters 

7 ntFromFrame Required. An integer that specifies the number of the first frame in the range. 
intToFrame Required. An integer that specifies the number of the last frame in the range. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable f r a me Si ze to the number of bytes needed to display frames 100 
to 125 of the movie: 

-- Lingo syntax 

frameSize = _movie.ramNeeded!100, 125) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var frameSize = _movie.ramNeededt100, 125): 


ramNeeded() 485 



This statement determines whether the memory needed to display frames 100 to 125 is more 
than the available memory, and, if it is, branches to the section using cast members that have 
lower color depth: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_movie.ramNeedecK 100, 125) > _system.freeBytes) then 
_movie.go("8-bit") 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 

if (_movie.ramNeeded(100, 125) > _system.freeBytes) { 

_movie.got"8-bit");

random() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

randomt integerExpression) 

II JavaScript syntax 
randomt integerExpression); 

Description 

Top level function; returns a random integer in the range 1 to a specified value. This function can 
be used to vary values in a movie, such as to vary the path through a game, assign random 
numbers, or change the color or position of sprites. 

To start a set of possible random numbers with a number other than 1, subtract the appropriate 
amount from the randomt ) function. For example, the expression randomt n + 1) - 1 uses a 
range from 0 to the number n. 

Parameters 

/ ntegerExpress ion Required. Specifies the maximum value of the random number. 

Example 

This statement assigns random values to the variable di ceRol 1: 

-- Lingo syntax 

diceRoll = (random(6) + random(6)) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var diceRoll = (random(6) + random(6)); 

This statement randomly changes the foreground color of sprite 10: 

-- Lingo syntax 

spritet10).foreColor = (random(256) - 1) 

// JavaScript syntax 

spritet10).foreColor = (random(256) - 1): 


486 Chapter 12: Methods 



This handler randomly chooses which of two movie segments to play: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on SelectScene 

if (random(2) = 2) then 
_movie.go("11a") 
el se 

_movie.go("lib") 
end if 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function SelectScene!) { 
if (random(2) == 1) { 

_movie.go("11a"); 

} else 1 

_movie.go("lib"); 



This statement produces a random multiple of 5 in the range 5 to 100: 

-- Lingo syntax 

theScore = (5 * random(20)) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var theScore = (5 * random!20)); 

randomVector() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
randomVector!) 

// JavaScript syntax 
randomVector!); 

Description 

Top level function; returns a unit vector describing a randomly chosen point on the surface of a 
unit sphere. 

This function differs from vector! random! 10) /10.0 , random! 10) /10.0 , random! 10) / 
10.0,) in that the resulting vector using randomVector! ) is guaranteed to be a unit vector. 

A unit vector always has a length of one. 

Parameters 

None. 


randomVector!) 487 



Example 


These statements create and display two randomly defined unit vectors in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
vecl = randomVector() 
vec2 = randomVector() 
put(vecl & RETURN & vec2) 

// JavaScript syntax 
var vecl = randomVector!); 
var vec2 = randomVector!); 
put(vecl + "\n" + vec2);

randomVector 

Usage 

randomVector!) 

Description 

3D command; returns a unit vector describing a randomly chosen point on the surface of a unit 
sphere. This method differs from vector! random(10)/10.0, random(10)/10.0, 
random(10)/10.0), in that the resulting vector is guaranteed to be a unit vector. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

These statements create and display two randomly defined unit vectors in the Message window: 

vec = randomVector!) 
put vec 

-- vector!-0.1155, 0.9833, -0.1408)

rawNew() 

Usage 

parentScript . rawNew!) 
rawNew {parentScript) 

Description 

Function; creates a child object from a parent script without calling its on new handler. This 
allows a movie to create child objects without initializing the properties of those child objects. 
This is particularly useful when you want to create large numbers of child objects for later use. To 
initialize the properties of one of these raw child objects, call its on new handler. 


488 Chapter 12: Methods 




Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement creates a child object called RedCar from the parent script CarParentScript 
without initializing its properties: 

RedCar = script("CarParentScript").rawNew!)

realPlayerNativeAudio() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
realPlayerNativeAudio() 

// JavaScript syntax 
realPlayerNativeAudio(); 

Description 

RealMedia function; allows you to get or set the global flag that determines whether the audio 
portion of the RealMedia cast member is processed by RealPlayer (TRUE) or by Director (FALSE). 
This function returns the previous value of the flag. 

To be effective, this flag must be set before RealPlayer is first loaded (when the first RealMedia 
cast member is encountered in the Score or with the first Lingo reference to a RealMedia cast 
member); any changes to this flag after RealPlayer is loaded are ignored. This flag should be 
executed in a prepa reMovi e event handler in a movie script. This flag is set for the entire session 
(from the time the Shockwave Player is launched until it is closed and relaunched), not just for 
the duration of the current movie. 

By default, this flag is set to FALSE and audio is processed by Director, which allows you to set the 
soundChannel property and use the standard Lingo sound methods and properties to manipulate 
the audio stream of a RealMedia sprite, including mixing RealAudio with other Director audio. If 
this flag is set to TRUE, Lingo control of the sound channel is not processed, and the sound is 
handled by RealPlayer. 

Parameters 

None. 


realPlayerNativeAudioQ 491 




Example 

The following code shows that the real PI ayerNati veAudi o( ) function is set to FALSE, which 
means that audio in the RealMedia cast member will be processed by Director: 

-- Lingo syntax 

putt real PIayerNativeAudio()) 

-- 0 

// JavaScript syntax 
tracetrealPlayerNativeAudio()); 

// 0 

The following code sets the real PI ayerNati veAudi o( ) function to TRUE, which means that 
audio in the RealMedia stream will be processed by RealPlayer and all Lingo control of the sound 
channel will be ignored: 

-- Lingo syntax 

real PIayerNativeAudio(TRUE) 

// JavaScript syntax 
real PIayerNativeAudio(1); 

See also 

soundChannel (RealMedia) 

realPlayerPromptTolnstall() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

real PIayerPromptToInstal1() 

// JavaScript syntax 

real PIayerPromptToInstalIt); 

Description 

RealMedia function; allows you to get or set a global flag that determines whether automatic 
detection and alert for RealPlayer 8 is enabled (TRUE) or not (FALSE). 

By default, this function is set to TRUE, which means that if users do not have RealPlayer 8 and 
attempt to load a movie containing RealMedia, they are automatically asked if they want to go to 
the RealNetworks website and install RealPlayer. You can set this flag to FALSE if you want to 
create your own detection and alert system using the real PI ayerVersi on () on page 493 
function and custom code. If this flag is set to FALSE and an alternate RealPlayer 8 detection and 
alert system is not in place, users without RealPlayer will be able to load movies containing 
RealMedia cast members, but the RealMedia sprites will not appear. 

This function detects the build number of the RealPlayer installed on the user’s system to 
determine whether RealPlayer 8 is installed. On Windows systems, build numbers 6.0.8.132 or 
later indicate that RealPlayer 8 is installed. On Macintosh systems, RealPlayer Core component 
build numbers 6.0.7.1001 or later indicate that RealPlayer 8 is installed. 

This flag should be executed in a prepareMovi e event handler in a movie script. 

This function returns the previous value of the flag. 


492 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters 


None. 

Example 

The following code shows that the real PI ayerPromptToInstal 1 () function is set to TRUE, 
which means users who do not have RealPlayer will be prompted to install it: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(real PIayerPromptToInstal 1 ()) -- 1 

// JavaScript syntax 
-- Lingo syntax 

trace(real PIayerPromptToInstall()): // 1 

The following code sets the real PI ayerPromptToInstal 1 ( ) function to FALSE, which means 
that users will not be prompted to install RealPlayer unless you have created a detection and 
alert system: 

-- Lingo syntax 

real PIayerPromptToInstal 1 (FALSE) 

// JavaScript syntax 

real PIayerPromptToInstal1(0); 

realPlayerVersion() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
real PIayerVersion() 

// JavaScript syntax 
real PIayerVersion(); 

Description 

RealMedia function; returns a string identifying the build number of the RealPlayer software 
installed on the user’s system, or an empty string if RealPlayer is not installed. Users must have 
RealPlayer 8 or later in order to view Director movies containing RealMedia content. On 
Windows systems, build numbers 6.0.8.132 or later indicate that RealPlayer 8 is installed. On 
Macintosh systems, RealPlayer Core component build numbers 6.0.7.1001 or later indicate that 
RealPlayer 8 is installed. 

The purpose of this function is to allow you to create your own RealPlayer detection and alert 
system, if you do not want to use the one provided by the function 

real PIayerPromptToInstal 1 () on page 492. 

If you choose to create your own detection and alert system using the realPlayerVersionO 
function, you must do the following: 

• Call real PI ayerPromptToInstal 1 ( FALSE) (by default, this function is set to TRUE) before 
any RealMedia cast members are referenced in Lingo or appear in the Score. This function 
should be set in a prepareMovi e event handler in a movie script. 

• Use the xt ra Li st system property to verify that the Xtra for RealMedia (RealMedia Asset.x32) 
is listed in the Movie Xtras dialog box. The real PI ayerVersi on () function will not work if 
the Xtra for RealMedia is not present. 


realPlayerVersionO 493 



The build number returned by this function is the same as the build number you can display 
in RealPlayer. 

To view the RealPlayer build number in Windows: 

1 Launch RealPlayer. 

2 Choose About RealPlayer from the Help menu. 

In the window that appears, the build number appears at the top of the screen in the 
second line. 

To view the RealPlayer build number on the Macintosh: 

1 Launch RealPlayer. 

2 Choose About RealPlayer from the Apple menu. 

The About RealPlayer dialog box appears. Ignore the build number listed in the second line at 
the top of the screen; it is incorrect. 

3 Click the Version Info button. 

The RealPlayer Version Information dialog box appears. 

4 Select RealPlayer Core in the list of installed components. 

The build number shown for RealPlayer Core component (for example, 6.0.8.1649) is the 
same as the build number returned by real PI ayerVersi on(). 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

The following code shows that build number of the RealPlayer installed on the system is 
6.0.9.357: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(realPlayerVersionO) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(realPlayerVersionO); 

recordFont 

Usage 

recordFont! whichCastMember, font I [.face]) ( ,[bitmapSizesI) { , characterSubset) 
1, userFontName]) 

Description 

Command; embeds a TrueType or Type 1 font as a cast member. Once embedded, these fonts are 
available to the author just like other fonts installed in the system. 

You must create an empty font cast member with the new! ) command before using recordFont. 

The command creates a Shock Font in whi chCastMember using the font named in the font 
parameter. The value returned from the command reports whether the operation was successful. 
Zero indicates success. 


494 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters 

font Required. Specifies the name of original font to be recorded. 

face Optional. Specifies a list of symbols indicating the face of the original font. Possible values 
are #pl ai n, #bol d, #i tal i c. If you do not provide a value for this parameter, #pl a i n is used. 

b 7 tmapS izes Optional. Specifies a list of integers specifying the sizes for which bitmaps are to be 
recorded. This parameter can be empty. If you omit this parameter, no bitmaps are generated. 
These bitmaps typically look better at smaller point sizes (below 14 points) but take up 
more memory. 

characterSubset Optional. Specifies a string of characters to be encoded. Only the specified 
characters will be available in the font. If this parameter is omitted, all characters are encoded. If 
only certain characters are encoded but an unencoded character is used, that character is displayed 
as an empty box. 

userFontName Optional. Specifies a string to use as the name of the newly recorded font 
cast member. 

Example 

This statement creates a simple Shock Font using only the two arguments for the cast member 
and the font to record: 

myNewFontMember = new(#font) 
recordFonttmyNewFontMember, "Lunar Lander") 

This statement specifies the bitmap sizes to be generated and the characters for which the font 
data should be created: 

myNewFontMember = new(#font) 

recordfonttmynewmember,"1 unar lander", [], [14, 18, 45], "Lunar Lander Game 

High \ Score First Last Name") 

Note: Since recordFont resynthesizes the font data rather than using it directly, there are no legal 
restrictions on Shock Font distribution.

rect() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

rect UntLeft, intTop, intRight, intBottom) 

II JavaScript syntax 

rect( intLeft, intTop, intRight, intBottom); 

Description 

Top level function; defines a rectangle. 

You can perform arithmetic operations on rectangles using both Lingo and JavaScript syntax. 

If you add a single value to a rectangle, Lingo and JavaScript syntax adds it to each element in 
the rectangle. 


rect() 495 



You can refer to rectangle components by list syntax or property syntax. For example, the 
following assignments set both myRectWi dthl and my RectWi dth2 to 50: 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myRect = rect(40,30,90,70); 

var myRectWidthl = myRect.right - myRect.left; // 50 
var myRectWidth2 = myRect[3] - myRect[l]; // 50 

To see an example of rect () used in a completed movie, see the Imaging movie in the Learning/ 
Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters 

/ nt Left Required. An integer that specifies the number of pixels that the left side of the rectangle 
is from the left edge of the Stage. 

intTop Required. An integer that specifies the number of pixels that the top side of the rectangle 
is from the top edge of the Stage. 

int Right Required. An integer that specifies the number of pixels that the right side of the 
rectangle is from the left edge of the Stage. 

/ nt Bottom Required. An integer that specifies the number of pixels that the bottom side of the 
rectangle is from the top edge of the Stage. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable newArea to a rectangle whose left side is at 100, top is at 150, 
right side is at 300, and bottom is at 400 pixels: 

-- Lingo syntax 

newArea = rect(100, 150, 300, 400) 

// JavaScript syntax 

var newArea = rect(100, 150, 300, 400); 

In Lingo only, the following statement sets the variable newArea to the rectangle defined by the 
points f i rstPoi nt and secondPoi nt: 

-- Lingo syntax 
firstPoint = pointdOO, 150) 
secondPoint = pointdOO, 400) 
newArea = rectifirstPoint, secondPoint) 

In Lingo only, these statements add and subtract values for rectangles: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put!rect(0, 0, 100, 100) + rect(30, 55, 120, 95)) -- rect(30, 55, 220, 195) 
put! rect(0, 0, 100, 100) -rect(30, 55, 120, 95)) -- rect(-30, -55, -20, 5) 

In Lingo only, this statement adds 80 to each coordinate in a rectangle: 

-- Lingo syntax 

putt recti60, 40, 120, 200) + 80) -- rect(140, 120, 200, 280) 

In Lingo only, this statement divides each coordinate in a rectangle by 3: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put!recti60, 40, 120, 200) / 3) -- rect(20, 13, 40, 66)

registerForEvent() 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .registerForEventl eventName , \ 

handlerName, scriptObject {, begin, period, repetitions )) 

Description 

3D command; declares the specified handler as the handler to be called when the specified event 
occurs within the specified cast member. 

The following parameter descriptions apply to both the registerForEventO and the 
regi sterScri pt() commands. 

Note: You can associate the registration of a script with a particular node rather than with a cast 
member by using the regi sterScri pt( ) command. 

Parameters 

eventName Required. Specifies the name of the event. The event can be any of the following 
predefined events, or any custom event that you define: 

• #col 1 i deAny is a collision event. 

• #col 1 i deWi th is a collision event involving this specific model. The 

setCol 1 i si onCal 1 back() command is a shortcut for using the regi sterScri pt() 
command for the #col 1 i deWi th event. 

• #ani mati on Started and #animati on Ended are notification events that occur when a bones 
or keyframe animation starts or stops playing. The handler will receive three arguments: 
eventName, motion, and time. The eventName argument is either #animationStarted or 
#ani mati onEnded. The motion argument is the name of the motion that has started or 
stopped playing, and t ime is the current time of the motion. 

• For looping animations, the #ani mati on St a rted event is issued only for the first loop, not 
for subsequent loops. During a blend of two animations, this event will be sent when the 
blending begins. 

• When a series of animations is queued for the model and the animation’s autoBlend property 
is set to TRUE, the #ani mati onEnded event may occur before the apparent end of a given 
motion. This is because the autoBl end property may make the motion appear to continue 
even though the animation has completed as defined. 

• #ti meMS is a time event. The first #ti meMS event occurs when the number of milliseconds 
specified in the begin parameter have elapsed after regi sterForEvent is called. The period 
parameter determines the number of milliseconds between #timeMS events when the value of 
repetitions is greater then 0. If repetitions is 0, the #timeMS event occurs indefinitely. 

handlerName Required. Specifies the name of the handler that will be called when the event 
eventName occurs; this handler is found in the script object indicated by scriptObject. The 
handler is sent the following arguments: 

• type is always 0. 

• delta is the elapsed time in milliseconds since the last #ti meMS event. 

• ti me is the number of milliseconds since the first #ti meMS event occurred. For example, if 
there are three iterations with a period of 500 ms, the first iteration’s time will be 0, the second 
iteration will be 500, and the third will be 1000. 


registerForEventO 497 



• duration is the total number of milliseconds that will elapse between the registerForEvent 
call and the last #ti me MS event. For example, if there are five iterations with a period of 500 
ms, the duration is 2500 ms. For tasks with unlimited iterations, the duration is 0. 

• systemT i me is the absolute time in milliseconds since the Director movie started. 

scriptObject Required. Specifies the script object that contains the handler handlerName. If 0 
is specified for scriptObject, then the first event handler with the given name found in a movie 
script is called. 

begin Optional. Specifies the number of milliseconds after regi sterForEvent() is called that 
the first #timeMS event occurs. 

period Optional. Specifies the number of milliseconds between #ti meMS events when the value 
of repet i t ions is greater then 0. 

repet i tions Optional. Specifies the number of repetitions for the #t i meMS event. If 
repetitions is 0, the#timeMS event occurs indefinitely. 

Example 

This statement registers the promptUser event handler found in a movie script to be called twice 
at an interval of 5 seconds: 

member("Scene").registerForEvent(#timeMS, #promptUser, 0, \ 

5000, 5000, 2) 

This statement registers the promptUser event handler found in a movie script to be called each 

time a collision occurs within the cast member named Scene: 

member!"Scene").registerForFvent(#col1ideAny, #promptUser, 0) 

This statement declares the on promptUser handler in the same script that contains the 
registerForEvent command to be called when any object collides with the model named Pluto 
in the cast member named Scene: 

member!"Scene").registerForEvent(#col1ideWith, #promptUser, me, \ 
member!"Scene" ) .model ("PI uto" ))

handlerName, scriptObject 1, begin, period, repetitions 1) 
member( whichCastmember). group! whichGroup) .registerScript! eventName, \ 
handlerName, scriptObject {, begin, period, repetitions )) 

Description 

3D command; registers the specified handler to be called when the specified event occurs for the 
referenced node. 

The following parameter descriptions apply to both the registerForEvent!) and the 
regi sterScri pt() commands. 


498 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters 

eventName Required. Specifies the name of the event. The event can be any of the following 
predefined events, or any custom event that you define: 

• #col 1 i deAny is a collision event. 

• #col 1 i deWi th is a collision event involving this specific model. The 

setCol 1 i si onCal 1 back( ) command is a shortcut for using the regi sterScri pt() 
command for the # col 1 i deWi th event. 

• #ani mati on Started and #ani mat i on Ended are notification events that occur when a bones 
or keyframe animation starts or stops playing. The handler will receive three arguments: 
eventName, motion, and time. The eventName argument is either #ani mati on Star ted or 
#ani mati onEnded. The motion argument is the name of the motion that has started or 
stopped playing, and t ime is the current time of the motion. 

For looping animations, the #ani mati onStarted event is issued only for the first loop, not 
for subsequent loops. During a blend of two animations, this event will be sent when the 
blending begins. 

When a series of animations is queued for the model and the animation’s autoBiend property 
is set to TRUE, the #ani mati onEnded event may occur before the apparent end of a given 
motion. This is because the autoBl end property may make the motion appear to continue 
even though the animation has completed as defined. 

• #ti meMS is a time event. The first #ti meMS event occurs when the number of milliseconds 
specified in the begin parameter have elapsed after regi sterForEvent is called. The period 
parameter determines the number of milliseconds between #ti meMS events when the value of 
repet i tions is greater then 0. If repet i ti ons is 0, the #ti meMS event occurs indefinitely. 

handl erName Required. Specifies the name of the handler that will be called when the event 
eventName occurs; this handler is found in the script object indicated by scriptObject. The 
handler is sent the following arguments: 

• type is always 0. 

• delta is the elapsed time in milliseconds since the last #ti meMS event. 

• ti me is the number of milliseconds since the first #ti meMS event occurred. For example, if 
there are three iterations with a period of 500 ms, the first iteration’s time will be 0, the second 
iteration will be 500, and the third will be 1000. 

• duration is the total number of milliseconds that will elapse between the registerForEvent 
call and the last #ti meMS event. For example, if there are five iterations with a period of 500

Description 

Window method; restores a window after it has been maximized. 

Use this method when making custom titlebars for movies in a window (MIAW). 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement restores the maximized window named Control Panel: 

-- Lingo syntax 

window!"Control Panel").restore!) 

// JavaScript syntax 

window("Control Panel").restore!); 

See also 

maximize!), Window 

result 

Usage 

the result 

Description 

Function; displays the value of the return expression from the last handler executed. 

The resul t function is useful for obtaining values from movies that are playing in windows 
and tracking Lingo’s progress by displaying results of handlers in the Message window as 
the movie plays. 

To return a result from a handler, assign the result to a variable and then check the variable’s 
value. Use a statement such as set myVariable = functionO, where function ( ) is the name 
of a specific function. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This handler returns a random roll for two dice: 

on diceRoll 

return random(6) + random(6) 
end 


result 505 



In the following example, the two statements 
diceRol1 

rol 1 = the result 

are equivalent to this statement: 

set rol 1 = diceRol1() 

The statement set roll = dice Roll would not call the handler because there are no 
parentheses following di ceRol 1; di ceRol 1 here is considered a variable reference.

508 Chapter 12: Methods 



Example 


The following frame script checks whether the Flash movie sprite in the sprite the behavior was 
placed in is playing and, if so, continues to loop in the current frame. When the movie is finished, 
the sprite rewinds the movie (so the first frame of the movie appears on the Stage) and lets the 
playhead continue to the next frame.

rollOver() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.rollOver(| intSpriteNum )) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.rol1Over(I IntSpriteNum )); 

Description 

Movie method; indicates whether the pointer (cursor) is currently over the bounding rectangle of 
a specified sprite (TRUE or 1) or not (FALSE or 0). 

The rol 1 Over () method is typically used in frame scripts and is useful for creating handlers that 
perform an action when the user places the pointer over a specific sprite. 

If the user continues to roll the mouse, the value of rol 1 Over () can change while a script is 
running a handler, and can result in unexpected behavior. You can make sure that a handler uses a 
consistent rollover value by assigning rol 1 0ver( ) to a variable when the handler starts. 

When the pointer is over an area of the Stage where a sprite previously appeared, rol 1 Over( ) still 
occurs and reports the sprite as still being there. Avoid this behavior by not performing rollovers 
over these locations, or by moving the sprite above the menu bar before removing it. 

Parameters 

intSpri teNum Optional. An integer that specifies the sprite number. 


rollOverQ 509 



Example 

This statement changes the content of the field cast member Message to “This is the place.” when 
the pointer is over sprite 6: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_movie.roll Over(6)) then 

membert"Message").text = "This is the place." 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_movie.roll Over(6)) { 

membert"Message").text = "This is the place."; 

1 


The following handler sends the playhead to different frames when the pointer is over certain 
sprites on the Stage. It first assigns the rol 1 Over value to a variable. This lets the handler use the 
rol 1 Over value that was in effect when the rollover started, regardless of whether the user 
continues to move the mouse. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame 

currentSprite = _movie.roll Overt) 
case currentSprite of 
1: _movie.goC"Left") 

2: _movie.goC"Middle") 

3; _movie.go("Right") 
end case 
end exitFrame 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFrameO { 

var currentSprite = _movie.roll Over(); 
switch (currentSprite) 1 
case 1: _movie.go("Left");

rotate 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .node( whichNode ). rotate( xAngle, yAngle, \ 
zAngle {, relativeTo }) 

member( whichCastmember) .node( whichNode). rotate (rotation Vector \ 

{ , relativeTo }) 

member( whichCastmember) .node( whichNode) .rotate( position, axis, \ 
angle I , relativeTo }) 

transform.rotateixAngle, yAngle, zAngle {, relativeTo )) 
transform. rotate (rotationVector {, relativeTo }) 
transform.rotateiposition, axis, angle {, relativeTo )) 

Description 

3D command; applies a rotation after the current positional, rotational, and scale offsets held by 
the node’s transform object or the directly referenced transform object. The rotation must be 
specified as a set of three angles, each of which specify an angle of rotation about the three 
corresponding axes. These angles may be specified explicitly in the form of xAng 1 e, yAng 1 e, and 
zAngle, or by a rotati onVector, where the x component of the vector corresponds to the 
rotation about the X axis, y about Y axis, and z about Z axis. Alternatively, the rotation may also 
be specified as a rotation about an arbitrary axis passing through a point in space. 

Parameters 

xAngl e Required if applying a rotation using x-, y-, and z-axes. Specifies the angle of rotation 
about the x-axis. 

yAngle Required if applying a rotation using x-, y-, and z-axes. Specifies the angle of rotation 
about the y-axis. 

zAngle Required if applying a rotation using x-, y-, and z-axes. Specifies the angle of rotation 
about the z-axis. 

rotati onVector Required if applying a rotation using a vector. Specifies the vector that contains 
the angles to apply. 

posit i on Required if applying a rotation about an arbitrary axis passing through a point in space. 
Specifies position in space. 

ax i s Required if applying a rotation about an arbitrary axis passing through a point in space. 
Specifies the axis passing through the specified position posi tion. 

angle Required if applying a rotation about an arbitrary axis passing through a point in space. 
Specifies the amount of rotation about the axis axis. 


rotate 511 



relativeTo Optional. Specifies which coordinate system axes are used to apply the desired 
rotational changes. The rel ati veTo parameter can have any of the following values: 

• #sel f applies the increments relative to the node’s local coordinate system (the X, Y and Z 
axes specified for the model during authoring). This value is used as the default if you use the 
rotate command with a node reference and the rel ati veTo parameter is not specified. 

• #pa rent applies the increments relative to the node’s parent’s coordinate system. This value is 
used as the default if you use the rotate command with a transform reference and the 

rel ati veTo parameter is not specified. 

• #worl d applies the increments relative to the world coordinate system. If a model’s parent is 
the world, than this is equivalent to using #pa rent. 

• nodeRef erence allows you to specify a node to base your rotation upon, the command applies 
the increments relative to the coordinate system of the specified node. 

Example 

The following example first rotates the model named Moon about its own Z axis (rotating it in 
place), then it rotates that same model about its parent node, the model named Earth (causing 
Moon to move orbitally about Earth). 

member("Scene").model("Moon").rotate! 0,0,15) 
member("Scene").model("Moon").rotate!vector(0, 0, 5), 
member!"Scene").model("Moon")) 

The following example rotates the model Ball around a position in space occupied by the model 
named Pole. The effect is that the model Ball moves in orbit around Pole in the x-y plane. 

polePos = member("3d Scene").model("Pole").worldPosition 
member("3d Scene").model("Bal1").rotate!polePos, vector(0,0,l), \ 

5, #world)

• Pro j ector —The movie is running as a projector. 

• BrowserPl ugi n —The movie is running as a Shockwave Player plug-in or other scripting 
environment, such as LiveConnect or ActiveX. 

The safest way to test for particular values in this property is to use the contains operator. This 
helps avoid errors and allows partial matches. 

Parameters 

None.

zSca1e) 

member( whichCastmember) .node( whichNode) .seal e( uniformSca1e) 
transform.scaleixScale, yScale, zScale) 
transform .seal e( uniformSca1e) 

Description 

3D transform command; applies a scaling after the current positional, rotational, and scale offsets 
held by a referenced node’s transform or the directly referenced transform. The scaling must be 
specified as either a set of three scalings along the corresponding axes or as a single scaling to be 
applied uniformly along all axes. You can specify the individual scalings using the xSca 1 e, ySca 1 e 
and zSca 1 e parameters, otherwise you can specify the uniform scaling amount using the 
un 7 formSca 1 e parameter. 

A node can be a camera, group, light or model object. Using the scale command adjusts the 
referenced node’s transform, scale property, but it does not have any visual effect on lights or 
cameras as they do not contain geometry. 

The scaling values provided must be greater than zero. 


514 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters 

xSca 1 e Required if specifying three scalings. Specifies the scale along the x-axis. 
yScale Required if specifying three scalings. Specifies the scale along the y-axis. 
zScal e Required if specifying three scalings. Specifies the scale along the z-axis. 
un 7 formSca 1 e Required if specifying a single, uniform scaling. Specifies the uniform scaling. 

Example 

This example first displays the transform, seal e property for the model named Moon, then it 
scales the model using the scale command, and finally, it displays the resulting 
transform, scale value. 

put member!"Scene").model("Moon").transform.seal e 
-- vector! 1.0000, 1.0000, 1.0000) 
member!"Scene").model("Moon"),scale(2.0,1.0,0.5) 
put member!"Scene").model("Moon").transform.seale 
-- vector! 2.0000, 1.0000, 0.5000) 

This statement scales the model named Pluto uniformly along all three axes by 0 . 5, resulting in 
the model displaying at half of its size. 

member!"Scene").model!"Pluto").seale(0.5) 

This statement scales the model named Oval in a nonuniform manner, scaling it along its z-axis 
but not its x- ory-axes.

seek() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. seek (mi 11iseconds) 

II JavaScript syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. seek (mi 11iseconds) ; 

Description 

RealMedia sprite or cast member method; changes the media stream’s playback location to the 
location specified by the number of milliseconds from the beginning of the stream. The 
medi aStatus value usually becomes #seeki ng and then #bufferi ng. 

You can use this method to initiate play at points other than the beginning of the RealMedia 
stream, or to jump forward or backward in the stream. The integer specified in mi 11 iseconds is 
the number of milliseconds from the beginning of the stream; thus, to jump backward, you 
would specify a lower number of milliseconds, not a negative number. 


seek!) 517 




If the seek command is called when medi aStatus is (/paused, the stream rebuffers and returns to 
#paused at the new location specified by seek. If seek is called when medi aStatus is #pl ayi ng, 
the stream rebuffers and automatically begins playing at the new location in the stream. If seek is 
called when medi aStatus is #cl osed, nothing happens. 

If you attempt to seek beyond the stream’s duration value, the integer argument you specify is 
clipped to the range from 0 to the duration of the stream. You cannot jump ahead into a 
RealMedia sprite that is streaming live content. 

The statement x. s e e k (n) is the same asx.currentTime = n,and either of these calls will cause 
the stream to be rebuffered. 

Parameters 

milliseconds Required. An integer that specifies the number of milliseconds from the beggining 
of the stream. 

Example 

The following examples set the current playback position of the stream to 10,000 milliseconds 
(10 seconds): 

-- Lingo syntax 
sprite(2).seek(lOOOO) 
member!"Real").seek!10000) 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(2).seek(10000); 
member!"Real").seek!10000);

sendAIISprites() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.sendAllSprites (stringEventMessage {, argsl) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.sendAl1SpritesC stringEventMessage {, argsl); 

Description 

Movie method; sends a designated message to all sprites, not just the sprite that was involved in 
the event. As with any other message, the message is sent to every script attached to the sprite, 
unless the stopEventO method is used. 


520 Chapter 12: Methods 



For best results, send the message only to those sprites that will properly handle the message 
through the sendSpri te( ) method. No error will occur if the message is sent to all the sprites, 
but performance may decrease. There may also be problems if different sprites have the 
same handler in a behavior, so avoid conflicts by using unique names for messages that will 
be broadcast. 

After the message has been passed to all behaviors, the event follows the regular message 
hierarchy: cast member script, frame script, then movie script. 

When you use the sendAllSprites!) method, be sure to do the following: 

• Replace stringEventMessage with the message. 

• Replace a rgs with any arguments to be sent with the message. 

If no sprite has an attached behavior containing the given handler, sendAl 1 Spri tes ( ) 
returns FALSE. 

Parameters 

stringEventMessage Required. A string that specifies the message to send to all sprites. 
a rgs Optional. An argument or arguments to send with the message. 

Example 

This handler sends the custom message al 1 Spri tesShoul dBumpCounter and the argument 2 to 
all sprites when the user clicks the mouse: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown me 

_movi e. sendAl 1 Spri tes(#al 1 spritesShouldBumpCounter, 2) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDown!) { 

_movie.sendAl1Sprites("al1spritesShoul dBumpCounter", 2);

sendEvent 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember). sendEvent(#eve/it/Vame, argl, arg2,...) 

Description 

3D command; sends an event and an arbitrary number of arguments to all scripts registered to 
receive the event. Use regi sterForEvent! ), or setCol 1 i si onCal 1 back! ) to register scripts 
for events. 

Parameters 

eventName Required. Specifies the name of the event to send. 

argl , arg2, . . . Required. One or more arguments that are sent with the event eventName. 


sendEvent 521 



Example 

The first line in this example creates an instance of a parent script named "tester". The second 
line sets the handler of the script instance, jumpPluto, as the handler to be called when the #j ump 
event is sent. The third line registers a movie script handler named jumpMars as another handler 
to be called when the #j ump event is sent. The fourth line sends the #j ump event. The handlers 
#j umpMa rs in a movie script and #j umpPl uto are called, along with any other handlers registered 
for the #j ump event. A script instance value of 0 indicates that you are registering a handler of a 
movie script, as opposed to a handler of a behavior instance or of a child of a parent script. 

t = new (script "tester") 

member!"scene").registerForEvent(#jump, #jumpPluto, t) 
member("scene").registerForEvent(#jump, #jumpMars, 0) 
member("scene").send Event(#jump)

sendSprite() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.sendSprite( spriteNameOrNum, event {, args }) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.sendSprite( spr1teNameOrNum, event {, args)); 

Description 

Movie method; sends a message to all scripts attached to a specified sprite. 

Messages sent using sendSpriteO are sent to each of the scripts attached to the sprite. The 
messages then follow the regular message hierarchy: cast member script, frame script, and 
movie script. 

If the given sprite does not have an attached behavior containing the given handler, 
sendSprite() returns FALSE. 

Parameters 

spri teNameOrNum Required. A string or an integer that specifies the name or number of the 
sprite that will receive the event. 

event Required. A symbol or string that specifies the event to send to the specified sprite. 
args Optional. An argument or arguments to send with the message. 

Example 

This handler sends the custom message bumpCounter and the argument 2 to sprite 1 when the 
user clicks: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown me 

_movie.sendSprite(1, #bumpCounter, 2) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDownO { 

_movie.sendSprite(1, "bumpCounter", 2);

setAlpha() 

Usage 

/ mageObject .setAl pha ( a 1phaLevel ) 
imageObject .setAl pha (a 1phaImageObject) 

Description 

Function; sets the alpha channel of an image object to a flat alphaLevel or to an existing 
al pha ImageObject. The alphaLevel must be a number from 0-255. Lower values cause the 
image to appear more transparent. Higher values cause the image to appear more opaque. The 
value 255 has the same effect as a value of zero. In order for the a 1 pha Level to have effect, the 
useAl pha () of the image object must be set to TRUE. 

The image object must be 32-bit. If you specify an alpha image object, it must be 8-bit. Both 
images must have the same dimensions. If these conditions are not met, setAl pha () has no effect 
and returns FALSE. The function returns TRUE when it is successful. 

Example 

The following Lingo statement makes the image of the bitmap cast member Foreground opaque 
and disables the alpha channel altogether. This is a good method for removing the alpha layer 
from an image: 

member("Foreground").image.setAl pha(255) 
member("Foreground").image.useAl pha = FALSE 

This Lingo gets the alpha layer from the cast member Sunrise and places it into the alpha layer of 
the cast member Sunset: 

tempAlpha = member!"Sunrise").image.extractAlpha() 
member!"Sunset").image.setAlpha(tempAlpha) 

See also 

useAlpha, extractAlpha() 

setaProp 

Usage 

setaProp list, 1istProperty, newValue 
setaProp (chi 1dObject. 1 1 stProperty, newValue ) 

1 i st. 1 / stProperty = newValue 
11st[7 istPropertyl = newValue 
childObject .1istProperty = newValue 

Description 

Command; replaces the value assigned to 1 istProperty with the value specified by newVa 1 ue. 
The setaProp command works with property lists and child objects. Using setaProp with a 
linear list produces a script error. 

• For property lists, setaProp replaces a property in the list specified by 1 ist. When the 
property isn’t already in the list, Lingo adds the new property and value. 

• For child objects, setaProp replaces a property of the child object. When the property isn’t 
already in the object, Lingo adds the new property and value. 


setaProp 523 




• The setaProp command can also set ancestor properties. 

Parameters 

1 7 stProperty Required. A symbol (Lingo only) or a string that specifies the name of the 
property whose value is changing. 

new Pa 1 ue Required. The new value for the 7 i stProperty property. 

Example 

These statements create a property list and then adds the item #c: 10 to the list: 

newList = [#a:1, #b:5] 
put newList 
-- [#a:1, #b:5] 
setaProp newList, #c, 10 
put newList 

Using the dot operator, you can alter the property value of a property already in a list without 
using setaProp: 

newList = [#a:1, #b:5] 

put newList 

-- [#a:1, #b:5] 

newLi st. b = 99 

put newList 

-- [#a:1, #b:99] 

Note: To use the dot operator to manipulate a property, the property must already exist in the list, 
child object, or behavior. 

See also 

ancestor, property, . (dot operator) 

setAt 

Usage 

setAt list, orderNumber , value 
1 i stiorderNumberU = value 

Description 

Command; replaces the item specified by orderNumber with the value specified by va 1 ue in the 
list specified by 1 ist. When orderNumber is greater than the number ofitems in a property list, 
the setAt command returns a script error. When orderNumber is greater than the number of 
items in a linear list, Director expands the list’s blank entries to provide the number of places 
specified by orderNumber. 

Example 

This handler assigns a name to the list [12, 34, 6, 7, 45], replaces the fourth item in the list with 
the value 10, and then displays the result in the Message window: 

on enterFrame 

set vNumbers = [12, 34, 6, 7, 45] 
setAt vnumbers, 4, 10 
put vNumbers 
end enterFrame 


524 Chapter 12: Methods 




When the handler runs, the Message window displays the following: 

[12, 34, 6, 10, 45] 

You can perform this same operation may be done using bracket access to the list in the 
following manner: 

on enterFrame 

set vNumbers = [12, 34, 6, 7, 45] 
vnumbers[4] = 10 
put vNumbers 
end enterFrame 

When the handler runs, the Message window displays the following: 

[12, 34, 6, 10, 45]

setCallback() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef.setCa~\~\back(actionScriptObject, ASEventName , ftLingoHandlerName, \ 
17ngoScriptObject) 

II JavaScript syntax 

spriteObjRef. setCallback( actlon SeriptObject , ASEventName , LingoHandlerName, 

1 7 ngoScriptObject ); 

Description 

Flash command; this command can be used as a sprite or a global method to define a Lingo 
callback handler for a particular event generated by the specified object. When ActionScript 
triggers the event in the object, that event is redirected to the given Lingo handler, including all 
arguments that are passed with the event. 

If the ActionScript object was originally created within a Flash sprite, use the 
fl ashSpri teReference syntax. If the object was originally created globally, use the 
global syntax. 

Note: If you have not imported any Flash cast members, you must manually add the Flash Asset Xtra 
to your movie’s Xtra list in order for global Flash commands to work correctly. You add Xtra 
extensions to the Xtra list by choosing Modify > Movie > Xtras. For more information about managing 
Xtra extensions for distributed movies, see the Using Director topics in the Director Help Panel. 

Parameters 

acti onScriptObject Required. Specifies the ActionScript object that contains the event 
ASEventName. 

ASEventName Required. Specifies the ActionScript event that occurs. 

1 / ngoHandlerName Required. Specifies the Lingo handler that handles the event ASEventName. 

17 ngoScri ptObject Required. Specifies the Lingo script object that contains the handler 
1 / ngoHandl erName. 


setCallbackQ 525 



Example 


This statement sets a the Lingo handler named myOnStatus in the Lingo script object me to be 
called when an on St at us event is generated by the ActionScript object t Local ConOb ject in the 
Flash movie in sprite 3: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(3).setCallbackitLocalConObject, "onStatus", #myOnStatus, me) 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(3).setCal1backitLocalConObject, "onStatus", symbol("myOnStatus"), me); 

The following statements create a new global XML object and create a callback handler that 
parses XML data when it arrives. The third line loads an XML file. The callback handler is 
included as well. 

-- Lingo syntax 

gXMLCB = newObjecti"XML") 

setCallbacki gXMLCB, "onData", //dataFound, 0 ) 
gXMLCB.load( "myfi1e.xml") 

-- Callback handler invoked when xml data arrives 
on dataFound me, obj, source 
obj.parseXML(source) 
obj.1oaded = 1 
obj.onload(TRUE) 
end dataFound 

// JavaScript syntax 
gXMLCB = newObjecti"XML"); 

setCallbacki gXMLCB, "onData", symbol("dataFound"), 0 ); 
gXMLCB.load( "myfile.xml" ); 

// Callback handler invoked when xml data arrives

setCollisionCallbackO 

Usage 

member ( whichCastmember) .model (.whichModel ) .col 1 i si on. \ 
setCol1isionCallback (tfhandlerName, scriptlnstance) 

Description 

3D collision command; registers a specified handler, in a given script instance, to be called when 
whichMode 1 is involved in a collision. 

This command works only if the model’s collision.enabled property is TRUE. The default 
behavior is determined by the value of colli si on.resolve, you can override it using the 
col 1 i si on . resol veA and/or the col 1 i si on . resol veB commands. Do not use the 
updateStage command in the specified handler. 


526 Chapter 12: Methods 



This command is a shorter alternative to using the regi sterScri pt command for collisions, but 
there is no difference in the overall result. This command can be considered to perform a small 
subset of the regi sterScri pt command functionality. 

Parameters 

handl erName Required. Specifies the handler called when a model is involved in a collision. 

scriptlnstance Required. Specifies the script instance that contains the handler specified by 

handl erName. 

Example 

This statement causes the #bounce handler in the cast member colScript to be called when the 
model named Sphere collides with another model: 

member("3d world").model("Sphere").col 1isi on.\ 
setCol1isionCal1back\ 

(#bounce, member!"col Seript"))

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef. set FI ashProperty ( targetName, # property, newVal ue) 

// JavaScript syntax 

spriteObjRef. set FIashProperty ( targetName, ftproperty, newValue); 

Description 

Function; allows Lingo to call the Flash action script function setProperty () on the given Flash 
sprite. Use the setFlashProperty( ) function to set the properties of movie clips or levels within 
a Flash movie. This is similar to setting sprite properties within Director. 

To set a global property of the Flash sprite, pass an empty string as the targetName. You can set 
the global Flash properties: #focusRect and #spri teSoundBufferTi me. 

See the Flash documentation for descriptions of these properties. 

Parameters 

targetName Required. Specifies the name of the movie clip or level whose property you want to 
set within the given Flash sprite. 

property Required. Specifies the name of the property to set. You can set the following movie 
clip properties: #posX, # posY, #scal eX, #scal eY, #vi si bl e, #rotate, #al pha, and #name. 

newla 1 ue Required. Specifies the new value. 

Example 

This statement sets the value of the #rotate property of the movie clip Star in the Flash member 
in sprite 3 to 180:

setPixel() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

imageObjRef. setPixel (x, y, col orObjOrlntVal ue) 
imageObjRef. setPi xel (poi nt ix, y) , col orObjOrlntVal ue) 

II JavaScript syntax 

imageObjRef .setPixel (x, y, colorObjOrlntValue); 
imageObjRef. setPixel (pointlx, y) , col orObjOrlntVal ue) ; 

Description 

Image method. Sets the color value of the pixel at a specified point in a given image. 

If setting many pixels to the color of another pixel with getPi xel (), it is faster to set them 
as integers. 

For best performance with color objects, use an indexed color object with 8-bit or lower images, 
and use an RGB color object with 16-bit or higher images. 

This method returns FALSE if the specified pixel falls outside the specified image. 

To see an example of this method used in a completed movie, see the Imaging movie in the 
Learning/Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters 

x Required if specifying a pixel using x and y coordinates. An integer that specifies the x 
coordinate of the pixel. 

y Required if specifying a pixel using x and y coordinates. An integer that specifies the y 
coordinate of the pixel. 

poi nt (x, y) Required if specifying a pixel using a point. A point that specifies the pixel. 


setPixel() 529 



col orObjOrlntVa 1 ue Required if setting the color to a color object or an integer value. A 
reference to a color object that specifies the color of the pixel, or an integer that specifies the color 
value of the pixel.

setPref() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.setPref( stringPrefName, prefString) 

II JavaScript syntax 

_player.setPref( stringPrefName , prefString); 

Description 

Player method; writes a specified string to a specified file on the computer’s local disk. The file is 
a standard text file. 


setPref!) 531 





After set P ref ( ) runs, if the movie is playing in a browser, a folder named Prefs is created in the 
Plug-In Support folder. The setPref ( ) method can write only to that folder. 

If the movie is playing in a projector or Director, a folder is created in the same folder as the 
application. The folder receives the name Prefs. 

Do not use this method to write to read-only media. Depending on the platform and version of 
the operating system, you may encounter errors or other problems. 

In a browser, data written bysetPrefO is not private; any movie with Shockwave content can 
read this information and upload it to a server. Do not store confidential information using 

setPref (). 

On Windows, setPref () fails if the user is a restricted user. 

To see an example of setPref( ) used in a completed movie, see the Read and Write Text movie 
in the Learning/Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters 

prefName Required. A string that specifies the file to write to. The prefName parameter must be 
a valid filename. To make sure the filename is valid on all platforms, use no more than eight 
alphanumeric characters for the file name. 

prefVa 1 ue Required. A string that specifies the text to write to the file prefName. 

Example 

This handler saves the contents of the field cast member Text Entry in a file named DayWare 
settings:

does not contain the specified property, setProp returns a script error. 

The setProp command works with property lists only. Using setProp with a linear list produces 
a script error. 


532 Chapter 12: Methods 



This command is similar to the setaProp command, except that setProp returns an error when 
the property is not already in the list. 

Parameters 

property Required. A symbol (Lingo only) or a string that specifies the property whose value is 
replaced by newVa 1 ue. 

newVa 1 ue Required. The new value for the property specified by property. 

Example 

This statement changes the value assigned to the age property of property list x to 11: 

setProp x, #age, 11 

Using the dot operator, you can alter the property value of a property already in a list, exactly as 
above: 

x.age =11

setScriptl_ist() 

Usage 

spriteReference.setSeriptList( scriptL1st) 
sprite( whichSprite) . setSeri ptLi st ( scriptList) 

Description 

This command sets the scri pt Li st of the given sprite. The scri ptLi st indicates which scripts 
are attached to the sprite and what the settings of each script property are. By setting this list, you 
can change which behaviors are attached to a sprite or change the behavior properties. 

The list takes the form: 

[ [ (whichBehaviorMember), " [ ftpropertyl: value, #property2: value, ...]", 
iiwhichBehaviorMember), " [ ftpropertyl: value, #property2\ value, ...]"]] 

This command cannot be used during a score recording session. Use setScri pt Li st() for 
sprites added during score recording after the score recording session has ended. 

Parameters 

scriptL ist Required. Specifies the script list for a given sprite.

settingsPanel() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri teObjRef. setti ngs Panel ({ i ntegerP artel Index) ) 

II JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. settingsPanel ({i ntegerPanel Index) ) ; 


settingsPanelQ 533 




Description 

Flash sprite command; invokes the Flash Settings dialog box to the specified panel index. This is 
the same dialog box that can be opened by right-clicking (Windows) or Control-clicking 
(Macintosh) on a Flash movie playing in a browser. 

The Settings dialog box will not be displayed if the Flash sprite’s rectangle is not large enough to 
accommodate it. 

If you want to emulate the Flash Player by invoking the Settings dialog box when a user right- 
clicks (Windows) or Control-clicks (Macintosh), you can use this command in a mouseDown 
handler that tests for the ri ghtMouseDown property or the control Down property. 

In order to emulate the Flash Player by enabling the Settings dialog box in a Director movie 
running in a browser, you must first disable the Shockwave Player context menu that is available 
by right-clicking (Windows) or Control-clicking (Macintosh) on a movie with Shockwave 
content playing in a browser. For information on how to disable this menu, see the Using 
Director topics in the Director Help Panel. 

Parameters 

/ntegerPane 1 Index Optional. Specifies which panel to activate when the dialog box is opened. 
Valid values are 0, 1,2, or 3. A value of 0 opens the dialog box showing the Privacy tab, a value of 
1 opens it showing the Local Storage tab, a value of 2 opens it showing the Microphone tab, and 
a value of 3 opens it showing the Camera tab. The default panel index is 0. 

Example 

This statement opens the Flash Settings panel with the Local Storage tab active: 

-- Lingo syntax 
sprite(3).settings Panel(1) 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(3).settingsPanel(1);

setPrefQ 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.setPref (stringPrefName, prefString) 

II JavaScript syntax 

_player.setPref( stringPrefName, prefString ); 

Description 

Player method; writes the string specified by pref Stri ng in the file specified by stri ngPrefName 
on the computer’s local disk. 

The stri ngPrefName argument must be a valid filename. To make sure the filename is valid on 
all platforms, use no more than eight alphanumeric characters for the file name. 

After the setPref () method runs, if the movie is playing in a browser, a folder named Prefs is 
created in the Plug-In Support folder. The setPref () method can write only to that folder. 


534 Chapter 12: Methods 



If the movie is playing in a projector or Director, a folder is created in the same folder as the 
application. The folder receives the name Prefs. 

Do not use this method to write to read-only media. Depending on the platform and version of 
the operating system, you may encounter errors or other problems. 

This method does not perform any sophisticated manipulation of the string data or its 
formatting. You must perform any formatting or other manipulation in conjunction with 
getPref (); you can manipulate the data in memory and write it over the old file using 

setPref (). 

In a browser, data written bysetPrefO is not private; any movie with Shockwave content can 
read this information and upload it to a server. Do not store confidential information using 

setPref (). 

On Windows, the setPref () method fails if the user is a restricted user. 

To see an example ofsetPrefO used in a completed movie, see the Read and Write Text movie 
in the Learning/Lingo folder inside the Director application folder. 

Parameters 

stri ngPrefName Required. A string that specifies the name of the file to which the string 
prefString is written. The file is a standard text file. 

pref Stri rig Required. The string to write to the file specified by stri ngPrefName. 

Example 

This handler saves the contents of the field cast member Text Entry in a file named DayWare 
settings:

Parameters 

whichTrack Required. Specifies the track to test. 


setTrackEnabledQ 535 



trueOrFalse Required. Specifies whether the track in the digital video is enabled (TRUE) or 
not (FALSE). 

Example 

This statement enables track 3 of the digital video assigned to sprite channel 8:

setVariable() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri teObjRef. setVari abl e( variableName, newVal ue) 

II JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. setVari abl e( vari abl eName, newVal ue): 

Description 

Function; sets the value of the given variable in the given Flash sprite. Flash variables were 
introduced in Flash version 4. 

Parameters 

vari abl eName Required. Specifies the name of the variable. 
newla 1 ue Required. Specifies the new value of the variable. 

Example 

The following statement sets the value of the variable currentURL in the Flash cast member in 
sprite 3. The new value of currentURL will be “http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/”. 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(3).setVariable("currentURL", \ 

"http://www.macromedia.com/software/f 1 ash /")

shader() 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).shader ( whichShader) 
member( whichCastmember) .shader[ index ] 
member( whichCastmember ).model (whichModel ).shader 
member! whichCastmember ).model Resource! whichModelResource).\ 
face[ index ].shader 

Description 

3D element, model property, and face property; the object used to define the appearance of the 
surface of the model. The shader is the “skin” which is wrapped around the model resource used 
by the model. 

The shader itself is not an image. The visible component of a shader is created with up to eight 
layers of texture. These eight texture layers are either created from bitmap cast members or 
image objects within Director or imported with models from 3D modeling programs. For more 
information, see texture. 

Every model has a linear list of shaders called the shaderlist. The number of entries in this list 
equals the number of meshes in the model resource used by the model. Each mesh can be shaded 
by only one shader. 

The 3D cast member has a default shader named Def aul tShader, which cannot be deleted. This 
shader is used when no shader has been assigned to a model and when a shader being used by a 
model is deleted. 

The syntax member! whi chCastmember) .model (whi chMode 1 ). shader gives access to the first 

shader in the model’s shaderlist and is equivalent to 

member! whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel) ,shaderList[l]. 

Create and delete shaders with the newShader!) and del eteShader!) commands. 

Shaders are stored in the shader palette of the 3D cast member. They can be referenced by name 
(wh i chShader) or palette index (shaderlndex). A shader can be used by any number of models. 
Changes to a shader will appear in all models which use that shader. 

There are four types of shaders: 

#standard shaders present their textures realistically. 

#pai nter, #engraver, and #newspri nt shaders stylize their textures for painting, engraving, and 
newsprint effects. They have special properties in addition to the #standard shader properties. 

The shaders used by individual faces of #mesh primitives can be set with the syntax 
member! whichCastmember ).model Resource! whichModelResource) .face! index ] .shader. 
Changes to this property require a call to the build!) command. 

Example 

This statement sets the shader property of the model named Wall to the shader named 
WallSurface: 

member("Room").model("Wal1").shader = \ 
member!"Room").shader!"WallSurface")

spriteSpaceT oWorldSpace 

Usage 

sprite( whichSprite). camera.spriteSpaceToWorldSpace( 7 oc) 
sprite(whichSprite).camera(index).spriteSpaceToWorldSpace(loc) 

Description 

3D command; returns a world-space position that is found on the specified cameras projection 
plane that corresponds to a location within the referenced sprite. 

The projection plane is defined by the camera's X and Y axes, and is at a distance in front of the 
camera such that one pixel represents one world unit of measurement. It is this projection plane 
that is used for the sprite display on stage. 

The camera . spri teSpaceToWorl dSpace( ) form of this command is a shortcut for using 
camera(1).spriteSpaceToWorl dSpace!). 

All cameras that are used by the referenced sprite will respond to the spri teSpaceToWorl dSpace 
command as if their display rect is the same size as the sprite. 


542 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters 

1 oc Required. Specifies the location in the referenced sprite. This location should be a point 
relative to the sprite’s upper-left corner.

stageBottom 

Usage 

the stageBottom 

Description 

Function; along with stageLeft, stageRi ght, and stageTop, indicates where the Stage is 
positioned on the desktop. It returns the bottom vertical coordinate of the Stage relative to the 
upper left corner of the main screen. The height of the Stage in pixels is determined by the 

stageBottom - the stageTop. 

When the movie plays back as an applet, the stageBottom property is the height of the applet 
in pixels. 

This function can be tested but not set. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

These statements position sprite 3 a distance of 50 pixels from the bottom edge of the Stage: 
stageHeight = the stageBottom - the stageTop 
sprite(3).1ocV = stageHeight - 50 

Sprite coordinates are expressed relative to the upper left corner of the Stage. For more 
information, see the Using Director topics in the Director Help Panel. 

See also 

stageLeft, stageRight, stageTop, locH, locV 

stageLeft 

Usage 

the stageLeft 

Description 

Function; along with stageRi ght, stageTop, and stageBottom, indicates where the Stage is 
positioned on the desktop. It returns the left horizontal coordinate of the Stage relative to the 
upper left corner of the main screen. When the Stage is flush with the left side of the main screen, 
this coordinate is 0. 

When the movie plays back as an applet, the stageLeft property is 0, which is the location of the 
left side of the applet. 

This property can be tested but not set. 

Sprite coordinates are expressed relative to the upper left corner of the Stage. 

Parameters 

None. 


544 Chapter 12: Methods 



Example 

This statement checks whether the left edge of the Stage is beyond the left edge of the screen and 
calls the handler 1 eftMoni torProcedure ifit is: 

if the stageLeft < 0 then 1eftMonitorProcedure

stageBottom, stageRight, stageTop, loch, locV 

stageRight 

Usage 

the stageRight 

Description 

Function; along with stageLeft, stageTop, and stageBottom, indicates where the Stage is 
positioned on the desktop. It returns the right horizontal coordinate of the Stage relative to the 
upper left corner of the main screen’s desktop. The width of the Stage in pixels is determined by 

the stageRight -the stageLeft. 

When the movie plays back as an applet, the stageRight property is the width of the applet 
in pixels. 

This function can be tested but not set. 

Sprite coordinates are expressed relative to the upper left corner of the Stage. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

These two statements position sprite 3 a distance of 50 pixels from the right edge of the Stage: 

stageWidth = the stageRight - the stageLeft 
sprite(3).1ocH = stageWidth - 50

stageToFlash() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef. stageToFl ash(po intOnDirectorStage ) 

// JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. stageToFl asb(.pointOnDirectorStage ); 

Description 

Function; returns the coordinate in a Flash movie sprite that corresponds to a specified coordinate 
on the Director Stage. The function both accepts the Director Stage coordinate and returns the 
Flash movie coordinate as Director point values: for example, point (300,300). 


stageToFlashQ 545 



Flash movie coordinates are measured in Flash movie pixels, which are determined by the original 
size of the movie when it was created in Flash. Point (0,0) of a Flash movie is always at its upper 
left corner. (The cast member’s or i gin Point property is not used to calculate movie coordinates; 
it is used only for rotation and scaling.) 

The stageToFlash( ) function and the corresponding flashToStageO function are helpful for 
determining which Flash movie coordinate is directly over a Director Stage coordinate. For both 
Flash and Director, point (0,0) is the upper left corner of the Flash Stage or Director Stage. These 
coordinates may not match on the Director Stage if a Flash sprite is stretched, scaled, or rotated. 

Parameters 

pointOnDirectorStage Required. Specifies the point on the Director stage. 

Example 

The following handler checks to see if the mouse pointer (whose location is tracked in Director 
Stage coordinates) is over a specific coordinate (130,10) in a Flash movie sprite in channel 5. If 
the pointer is over that Flash movie coordinate, the script stops the Flash movie. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on checkFlashRol1 over 

if sprite(5).stageToFlash(point(_mouse.mouseH,_mouse.mouseV)) = 
point(130,10) then 
sprite(5).stop() 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function checkFlashRol1over() { 

var stf = sprite(5).stageToFlashlpoint(_mouse.mouseH,_mouse.mouseV)); 
if (stf = point(130,10)) 1

stageTop 

Usage 

the stageTop 

Description 

Function; along with stageBottom, stageLeft, and stageRi ght, indicates where the Stage is 
positioned on the desktop. It returns the top vertical coordinate of the Stage relative to the upper 
left corner of the main screens desktop. If the Stage is in the upper left corner of the main screen, 
this coordinate is 0. 

When the movie plays back as an applet, the stageTop property is always 0, which is the location 
of the left side of the applet. 

This function can be tested but not set. 

Sprite coordinates are expressed relative to the upper left corner of the Stage. 


546 Chapter 12: Methods 



Parameters

stop!) (RealMedia, SWA, Windows Media) 549 



stopEvent() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.stopEvent() 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.stopEvent(); 

Description 

Movie method; prevents scripts from passing an event message to subsequent locations in the 
message hierarchy. 

This method also applies to sprite scripts. 

Use the stopEventO method to stop the message in a primary event handler or a sprite script, 
thus making the message unavailable for subsequent sprite scripts. 

By default, messages are available first to a primary event handler (if one exists) and then to any 
scripts attached to a sprite involved in the event. If more than one script is attached to the sprite, 
the message is available to each of the sprite’s scripts. If no sprite script responds to the message, 
the message passes to a cast member script, frame script, and movie script, in that order. 

The stopEventO method applies only to the current event being handled. It does not affect 
future events. The stopEventO method applies only within primary event handlers, handlers 
that primary event handlers call, or multiple sprite scripts. It has no effect elsewhere. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement shows the mousellp event being stopped in a behavior if the global variable 
grandTotal is equal to 500: 

-- Lingo syntax 
global grandTotal 

on mousellp me 

if (grandTotal = 500) then 
_movie.stopEvent() 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
_global.grandTotal; 

function mouseUp() { 

if (_global.grandTotal == 500) 1 

_movie.stopEvent(); 

1 

1 

Neither subsequent scripts nor other behaviors on the sprite receive the event if it is stopped in

stream() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberObjRef. stream (numberOfBytes) 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. stream (numberOf Bytes); 

Description 

Command; manually streams a portion of a specified Flash movie cast member into memory. 

The stream command returns the number of bytes actually streamed. Depending on a variety of 
conditions (such as network speed or the availability of the requested data), the number of bytes 
actually streamed may be less than the number of bytes requested. 

You can always use the stream command for a cast member regardless of the cast member’s 
streamMode property. 

Parameters 

numberOf Bytes Optional. An integer that specifies the number of bytes to stream. If you omit 
the numberOf Bytes parameter, Director tries to stream the number of bytes set by the cast 
member’s butferSi ze property. 

Example 

The following frame script checks to see if a linked Flash movie cast member has streamed into 
memory by checking its percentStreamed property. If the cast member is not completely loaded 
into memory, the script tries to stream 32,000 bytes of the movie into memory. 

The script also saves the actual number of bytes streamed in a variable called bytesRecei ved. If 
the number of bytes actually streamed does not match the number of bytes requested, the script 
updates a text cast member to report the number of bytes actually received. The script keeps the 
playhead looping in the current frame until the cast member has finished loading into memory.

string() 

Usage 

string( expression ) 

Description 

Function; converts an integer, floating-point number, object reference, list, symbol, or other 
nonstring expression to a string. 

Parameters 

expression Required. The expression to convert to a string. 

Example 

This statement adds 2.0 + 2.5 and inserts the results in the field cast member Total: 

member!"total").text = string(2.0 + 2.5)

stringP() 

Usage 

stringP! expression ) 

Description 

Function; determines whether an expression is a string (TRUE) or not (FALSE). 

The P in s t r i n g P stands for predicate. 

Parameters 

expression Required. The expression to test. 

Example 

This statement checks whether 3 is a string: 
put stringP("3") 

The result is 1, which is the numeric equivalent of TRUE. 


552 Chapter 12: Methods 




This statement checks whether the floating-point number 3.0 is a string: 

put stringP(3.0) 

Because 3.0 is a floating-point number and not a string, the result is 0, which is the numeric 
equivalent of FALSE.

wh 7 chQTVRSpri te is the sprite number of the sprite with the QuickTime VR member. 


554 Chapter 12: Methods 



The function returns immediately, but the sprite continues to change view until it reaches 
the final view. The duration required to change to the final settings varies depending on 
machine type, size of the sprite rectangle, color depth of the screen, and other typical 
performance constraints.

tellStreamStatus() 

Usage 

tellStreamStatus ( onOrOffBoolean) 

Description 

Function; turns the stream status handler on (TRUE) or off (FALSE). 

The form tel 1 StreamStatus () determines the status of the handler. 

When the streamStatusHandl er is TRUE, Internet streaming activity causes periodic calls to the 
movie script, triggering streamStatusHandler. The handler is executed, with Director 
automatically filling in the parameters with information regarding the progress of the downloads. 

Parameters 

onOrOffBoolean Optional. Specifies the status of the handler. 

Example 

This on prepareMovi e handler turns the on StreamStatus handler on when the movie starts: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on prepareMovie 

tellStreamStatus(TRUE)

tellTarget() 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef.te 1 lTarget( targetName) 

// JavaScript syntax 
spriteObjRef.te 1 lTarget( targetName ) ; 

Description 

Command; equivalent to the Flash beginTellTarget and endTell Target methods. The 
tellTargetO command allows the user to set a target Timeline on which subsequent sprite 
commands will act. When the target is set to a Flash movie clip or a level containing a loaded 
Flash movie, certain commands act on the targeted components, rather than on the main 
Timeline. To switch focus back to the main Timeline, call endTel 1 Ta rget (). 

The only valid argument for tellTarget is the target name. There is no valid argument for 
endTel 1 Target. 

The Flash sprite functions that are affected by tel ITarget are stop, pi ay, getProperty, 
set Property, goto Frame, cal 1 (frame), and f i nd (1 abel ). In addition, the sprite property 
frame (which returns the current frame) is affected by tellTarget. 

Parameters 

targetName Required. Specifies the target name. 

Example 

This command sets the movie clip as the target: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(1).tel 1 Target("\myMovieCl ip") 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(1).tel 1 Target!"\myMovieCl ip"); 

This command stops the movie clip: 

-- Lingo syntax 
sprite(1).stop() 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(1).stop(); 

This command causes the movie clip to play: 

-- Lingo syntax 
sprite(1).piay() 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(1).piay(); 

This command switches the focus back to the main Timeline: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(1).endTel1 Target!) 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(1).endTel1 Target!);

member( whichCastmember) .texture[ index ] 

member( whichCastmember) .shader( whichShader) .texture 

member! whichCastmember ).model (whichModel ).shader . texture 

member( whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel) .shaderList.texture 

member! whichCastmember) .model( whichModel) ,shaderList[ index ].texture 

member! whichCastmember ).model Resource!whi chParticleSystemModel\ 

Resource ).texture 

Description 

3D element and shader property; an image object used by a shader to define the appearance of the 
surface of a model. The image is wrapped onto the geometry of the model by the shader. 

The visible component of a shader is created with up to eight layers of textures. These eight 
texture layers are either created from bitmap cast members or image objects within Director or 
imported with models from 3D modeling programs. 

Create and delete textures with the newTexture!) and del eteTexture!) commands. 

Textures are stored in the texture palette of the 3D cast member. They can be referenced by name 
(whichTexture) or palette index ( texturelndex ). A texture can be used by any number of 
shaders. Changes to a texture will appear in all shaders which use that texture. 

There are three types of textures: 

#f romCastmember; the texture is created from a bitmap cast member using the 
newTexture!) command. 

#f romlmageObject; the texture is created from a lingo image object using the 
newTexture!) command. 

#i mportedFromFi 1 e; the texture is imported with a model from a 3D modeling program. 

The texture of a particle system is a property of the model resource, whose type is #parti cl e. 

Example 

This statement sets the texture property of the shader named WallSurface to the texture 
named BluePaint: 

member("Room").shader!"Wal1 Surface").texture = \ 
member!"Room").texture!"B1uePaint")

Usage 

model Res ourceObjectReference .topCap 

Description 

3D command; when used with a model resource whose type is #cyl i nder, allows you to both get 
and set the topCap property of the model resource. 

The topCap property determines whether the top cap of the cylinder is sealed (TRUE) or open 
(FALSE). The default value for this property is FALSE. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This statement sets the topCap property of the model resource Tube to FALSE, meaning the top of 
this cylinder will be open: 

member("3D World").modelResource("Tube").topCap = FALSE 

topRadius 

Usage 

model ResourceObjectReference. topRadi us 

Description 

3D command; when used with a model resource whose type is #cyl i nder, allows you to both get 
and set the topRadius property of the model resource, as a floating-point value. 

The topRadi us property determines the radius of the top cap of the cylinder. This property must 
always be 0.0 or greater. The default value is 25.0. Setting topRadi us to 0.0 produces a cone. 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

The following statement sets the topRadi us property of the model resource Tube to 0.0. If the 
bottom radius has a value greater than 0, models using Tube will be conical. 

member("3D World").modelResource("Tube").topRadius = 0.0

transform (command) 

Usage 

transform!) 

transform! nl, n2, n3 . nl4,nl5,nl6) 

Description 

3D command; this command creates a transform object. When this command is used without 
providing any parameters it creates a transform object equal to the identity transform. The 
identity transform has positional and rotational components of vector(0,0,0), and it has a scale 
component of vector( 1,1,1). When this command is used while providing sixteen parameters in 
the form of nl,n2,n3, ... ,nl4,n!5,nl6 then this command creates a transform object using those 
16 entries for the transform data. 

Parameters 

nl, n2, n3, ... ,nl4, nl5, niff Optional. Specifies the sixteen parameters that are used as 
the transform data when creating the transform object. 


transform (command) 563 




Example 


This statement creates an identity transform and stores it in the variable tTransform: 
tTransform = transformO 

This statement creates an identity transform by specifying all 16 of its elements, and it stores the 
new transform in the variable tTransform. 

tTransform = transform!1.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000, \ 

0.0000,1.0000,0.0000,0.0000, 0.0000,0.0000,1.0000,0.0000, \ 
0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,1.0000) 

This statement creates a custom transform by specifying all 16 of its elements, and it stores the 
new transform in the variable tTransform. The transform created has a posi ti on property of 
vector(19.2884, 1.7649, 4.2426), a rotati on property of vector! 75.7007 , 0.0000, - 
6.5847 ) and a seal e property of vector (0.4904 , 0.7297, 0.3493).

(.translateVector {, relativeTo }) 
transform .transl ateixlncrement, ylncrement, zlncrement \ 

{ , relativeTo }) 

transform, transl ate! translateVector {, relativeTo )) 

Description 

3D command; applies a translation after the current positional, rotational, and scale offsets held 
by a referenced node’s transform object or the directly referenced transform object. The 
translation must be specified as a set of three increments along the three corresponding axes. 
These increments may be specified explicitly in the form of xlncrement, ylncrement, and 
zlncrement, or by a transl ateVector, where the x component of the vector corresponds to the 
translation along the x axis, y about y axis, and z about z axis. 

A node can be a camera, model, light or group object. 

Parameters 

xlncrement Required if specifying a set of three increments. Specifies the x-axis increment. 

ylncrement Required if specifying a set of three increments. Specifies the y-axis increment. 

zlncrement Required if specifying a set of three increments. Specifies the z-axis increment. 

trans 1 ateVector Required if specifying a vector. Specifies the vector that contains the x, y, and 
z components. 


564 Chapter 12: Methods 



relativeTo Optional. Determines which coordinate system’s axes are used to apply the desired 
translational changes. The rel ati veTo parameter can have any of the following values: 

• #sel f applies the increments relative to the node’s local coordinate system (the x, y and z axes 
specified for the model during authoring). This value is used as the default if you use the 
transl ate command with a node reference and the rel ati veTo parameter is not specified. 

• #pa rent applies the increments relative to the node’s parent’s coordinate system. This value is 
used as the default if you use the translate command with a transform reference and the 
rel ati veTo parameter is not specified. 

• #worl d applies the increments relative to the world coordinate system. If a model’s parent is 
the world, than this is equivalent to using #pa rent. 

• nodeReference allows you to specify a node to base your translation upon, the command 
applies the translations relative to the coordinate system of the specified node. 

Example 

This example constructs a transform using the transform command, then it initializes the 
transform’s position and orientation in space before assigning the transform to the model named 
mars. Finally this example displays the resulting position of the model.

Description 

Member method; forces Director to clear the specified cast members from memory. 

Director automatically unloads the least recently used cast members to accommodate preLoad () 
methods or normal cast library loading. 

• When used without a parameter, un Load () clears from memory the cast members in all the 
frames of a movie. 

• When used with the toMemberObjRef parameter, unLoad() clears from memory all the cast 
members in the range specified. 

When used in a new movie with no loaded cast members, this method returns an error. 

Cast members that you have modified during authoring or by setting pi cture, 
pasted i pBoadInto(), and so on, cannot be unloaded. 

Parameters 

toMemberObj Ref Optional. A reference to the last cast member in the range to clear 
from memory.

Description 

Movie method; forces Director to clear the cast members used in a specified frame from memory. 
Director automatically unloads the least recently used cast members to accommodate preLoad () 
methods or normal cast library loading. 

• When used without an argument, the unLoadMember() method clears from memory the cast 
members in all the frames of a movie. 

• When used with one argument, memberObjRef, the unLoadMember() method clears from 
memory the cast members in that frame. 

• When used with two arguments, fromMemberNameOrNum and toMemberNameOrNum, the 
unLoadMember() method unloads all cast members in the range specified. You can specify a 
range of cast members by frame numbers or frame labels. 

Parameters 

membe r Ob j Ref Optional. A reference to the cast member to unload from memory. 

fromMemberNameOrNum Required if clearing a range of cast members. A string or integer that 
specifies the name or number of the first cast member in a range to unload from memory. 

toMemberNameOrNum Required if clearing a range of cast members. A string or integer that 
specifies the name or number of the last cast member in a range to unload from memory. 

Example 

This statement clears from memory the cast member Screen 1: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.unLoadMember(member("Screenl")) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.unLoadMember(member("Screenl)); 

This statement clears from memory all cast members from cast member 1 to cast member Big 
Movie: 

-- Lingo syntax

URLEncode 

Usage 

URLEncode(prop7 ist_or_string {, serverOSString) {, characterSet )) 

Description 

Function; returns the URL-encoded string for its first argument. Allows CGI parameters to be 
used in other commands. The same translation is done as for postNetText and getNetText() 
when they are given a property list. 

Parameters 

propListOrString Required. Specifies the property list or string to be URL-encoded. 

serverOSStri ng Optional. Encodes any return characters in propLi stOrStri ng. The value 
defaults to "Unix" but may be set to "Win" or "Mac" and translates any carriage returns in 
propLi stOrStri ng into those used on the server. For most applications, this setting is 
unnecessary because line breaks are usually not used in form responses. 

characterSet Optional. Applies only if the user is running on a Shift-JIS (Japanese) system. Its 
possible settings are "JIS", "EUC", "ASCII", and "AUTO". Retrieved data is converted from Shift- 
JIS to the named character set. Returned data is handled exactly as by getNetText!) (converted 
from the named character set to Shift-JIS). If you use "AUTO", the posted data from the local 
character set is not translated; the results sent back by the server are translated as they are for 
getNetTextO. "ASCII" is the default if characterSet is omitted. "ASCII" provides no 
translation for posting or results. 

Example 

In the following example, URLEncode supplies the URL-encoded string to a CGI query at the 
specified location. 

URL = "http://aserver/cgi-bin/echoquery.cgi" 

gotonetpage URL & "?" & URLEncode! [#name: "Ken", #hobby: "What?"] )

value() 

Usage 

value( stringExpression) 

Description 

Function; returns the value of a string. When value!) is called, Lingo parses through the 
stri ngExpressi on provided and returns its logical value. 


572 Chapter 12: Methods 



Any Lingo expression that can be put in the Message window or set as the value of a variable can 
also be used with val ue( ). 

These two Lingo statements are equivalent: 

put sprite(2).member.duration * 5 

put value("sprite(2).member.duration * 5") 

These two Lingo statements are also equivalent: 

x = (the mouseH - 10) / (the mouseV + 10) 
x = value("(the mouseH - 10) / (the mouseV + 10)") 

Expressions that Lingo cannot parse will produce unexpected results, but will not produce Lingo 
errors. The result is the value of the initial portion of the expression up to the first syntax error 
found in the string. 

The val ue( ) function can be useful for parsing expressions input into text fields by end-users, 
string expressions passed to Lingo by Xtra extensions, or any other expression you need to convert 
from a string to a Lingo value. 

Keep in mind that there may be some situations where using value! ) with user input can be 
dangerous, such as when the user enters the name of a custom handler into the field. This will 
cause the handler to be executed when it is passed to val ue( ). 

Do not confuse the actions of the value function with the integer!) andfloatO functions. 

Parameters 

stringExpress ion Required. Specifies the string from which a value is returned. The string can 
be any expression that Lingo can understand. 

Example 

This statement displays the numerical value of the string "the sqrt of" && "2.0": 
put valueC'the sqrt of" && "2.0") 

The result is 1.4142. 

This statement displays the numerical value of the string “penny”: 
put value("penny") 

The resulting display in the Message window is VOID, because the word penny has no 
numerical value. 

You can convert a string that is formatted as a list into a true list by using this syntax: 

myString = "[" & QUOTE & "cat" & QUOTE & ", " & QUOTE & "dog" & QUOTE & "]" 
myList = val ue(myStri ng) 
put myList 
-- ["cat", "dog"] 

This allows a list to be placed in a field or text cast member and then extracted and easily 
reformatted as a list. 

This statement parses the string "3 5" and returns the value of the portion of the string that Lingo 
understands: 

put value("3 5") 

-- 3

CHAPTER 13 

Operators 


This section provides an alphabetical list of all the operators available in Macromedia Director 
MX 2004. 

The majority of these operators apply only to Lingo. JavaScript syntax does contain some 
operators that are either similar or identical to the Lingo operators listed here; therefore, where 
appropriate, JavaScript syntax usage and examples are provided to help you map the functionality 
of Lingo operators with their closest counterparts in JavaScript syntax. For more information 
about JavaScript syntax operators, see Chapter 2, “Director Scripting Essentials,” on page 9. 

# (symbol) 

Usage 

--Lingo syntax 
^symbol Name 

// JavaScript syntax 
symbol ("symbol Name "); 

Description 

Symbol operator; defines a symbol, a self-contained unit that can be used to represent a condition 
or flag. The value s ymbo 1 Name begins with an alphabetical character and may be followed by any 
number of alphabetical or numerical characters. 

A symbol can do the following: 

• Assign a value to a variable. 

• Compare strings, integers, rectangles, and points. 

• Pass a parameter to a handler or method. 

• Return a value from a handler or method. 

A symbol takes up less space than a string and can be manipulated, but unlike a string it does not 
consist of individual characters. You can convert a symbol to a string for display purposes by using 
the string function. 

The following are some important points about symbol syntax: 

• Symbols are not case-sensitive. 

• Symbols can’t start with a number. 

• Spaces may not be used, but you can use underscore characters to simulate them. 


591 



• Symbols use the 128 ASCII characters, and letters with diacritical or accent marks are treated 
as their base letter. 

• Periods may not be used in symbols. 

All symbols, global variables, and names of parameters passed to global variables are stored in a 
common lookup table. 

Example 

This statement sets the state variable to the symbol #P1 ayi ng: 

-- Lingo syntax 
state = #P1aying 

// JavaScript syntax 

var state = symbol("PIaying"); 

See also 

i1k(), string!), symbol!), symbolP() 

. (dot operator) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

objectReference.objectProperty 
textExpression.objectProperty 
object. commandOrFunctioni ) 

// JavaScript syntax 
objectReference.objectProperty; 
textExpression.objectProperty; 
object.commandOrFunction (); 

Description 

Operator; used to test or set properties of objects, or to issue a command or execute a function of 
the object. The object may be a cast member, a sprite, a property list, a child object of a parent 
script, or a behavior. 

Example 

This statement displays the current member contained by the sprite in channel 10: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(spritedO).member) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(spritedO).member); 

To use the alternate syntax and call a function, you can use this form: 

-- Lingo syntax 

myColorObject = color(124, 22, 233) 
put(myColorObject.i1k()) 

-- #color 

// JavaScript syntax 

var myColorObject = color(124, 22, 233); 
put(myColorObject.i1k()); 

// #color 


592 Chapter 13: Operators 



expression2 


- (minus) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
(Negation): -expression 
(Subtraction): expressionl - 

II JavaScript syntax 
(Negation): -expression 
(Subtraction): expressionl - expression2 

Description 

Math operator; when used for negation, - (minus) reverses the sign of the value of expression; 
when used for subtraction, - (minus) performs an arithmetic subtraction on two numerical 
expressions, subtracting expression2 from expressionl. 

When used for negation, - (minus) is an arithmetic operator with a precedence level of 5. 

When used for subtraction, both expressions are integers, the difference is an integer. When either 
or both expressions are floating-point numbers, the difference is a floating-point number. The 
- (minus) operator is an arithmetic operator with a precedence level of 3. 

Example 

(Negation): This statement reverses the sign of the expression 2 + 3: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(-(2 + 3)) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(-(2 + 3)); 

The result is -5. 

(Subtraction): This statement subtracts the integer 2 from the integer 5 and displays the result in 
the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(5 - 2) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(5 - 2); 

The result is 3, which is an integer. 

(Subtraction): This statement subtracts the floating-point number 1.5 from the floating-point 
number 3.25 and displays the result in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(3.25 - 1.5) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(3.25 - 1.5); 

The result is 1.75, which is a floating-point number. 


- (minus) 593 



-- (comment) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
-- comment 

// JavaScript syntax 
// comment 

Description 

Comment delimiter; indicates the beginning of a script comment. On any line, anything that 
appears between the comment delimiter (double hyphen) and the end-of-line return character is 
interpreted as a comment rather than a Lingo statement. 

Example 

This handler uses a double hyphen to make the second, fourth, and sixth lines comments: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on resetColors 

-- This handler resets the sprite’s colors, 
sprite(1).forecolor = 35 
-- bright red 
sprite(1).backed or = 36 
- - 1ight blue 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function resetColors() { 

// this handler resets the sprite’s colors 
sprite(1).forecolor = 35; 

// bright red 

sprite(1).backed or = 36; 

// 1ight blue 

1 

&, + (concatenation operator) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
express!onl & express!on2 

// JavaScript syntax 
express!onl + express!on2 

Description 

String operator; performs a string concatenation of two expressions. If either expression1 or 
express!on2 is a number, it is first converted to a string. The resulting expression is a string. 

This is a string operator with a precedence level of 2. 

Lingo allows you to use some commands and functions that take only one argument without 
parentheses surrounding the argument. When an argument phrase includes an operator, Lingo 
interprets only the first argument as part of the function, which may confuse Lingo. 


594 Chapter 13: Operators 



Avoid this problem by placing parentheses around the entire phrase that includes an operator. 
The parentheses clear up Lingo’s confusion by changing the precedence by which Lingo deals 
with the operator, causing Lingo to treat the two parts of the argument as one complete 
argument. 

Example 

This statement concatenates the strings “abra” and “cadabra” and displays the resulting string in 
the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
putC'abra" & "cadabra") 

// JavaScript syntax 
putC'abra" + "cadabra"); 

The result is the string “abracadabra”. 

This statement concatenates the strings and the content of the pri ce variable and then 
assigns the concatenated string to the Price field cast member: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("Price").text = "$" & price 

// JavaScript syntax 

member("Price").text = "$" + price: 

&&, + (concatenation operator) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

exp res sionl && expression2 

II JavaScript syntax 
expressionl + expression2 

Description 

String operator; concatenates two expressions, inserting a space character between the original 
string expressions. If either express i onl or express i on2 is a number, it is first converted to a 
string. The resulting expression is a string. 

This is a string operator with a precedence level of 2. 

Example 

This statement concatenates the strings “abra” and “cadabra” and inserts a space between the two: 

-- Lingo syntax 
putC'abra" && "cadabra") 

// JavaScript syntax 
putC'abra " + "cadabra"); 

The result is the string “abra cadabra”. 


&&, + (concatenation operator) 595 



This statement concatenates the strings “Today is” and todays date in the long format and inserts 
a space between the two: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put( "Today is" && dateO) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put( "Today is " + DateO); 

() (parentheses) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
( expression ) 

// JavaScript syntax 
( expression ) 

Description 

Grouping operator; performs a grouping operation on an expression to control the order of 
execution of the operators in an expression. This operator overrides the automatic precedence 
order so that the expression within the parentheses is evaluated first. When parentheses are nested, 
the contents of the inner parentheses are evaluated before the contents of the outer ones. 

This is a grouping operator with a precedence level of 5. 

Be aware that Lingo allows you to use some commands and functions that take only one 
argument without parentheses surrounding the argument. When an argument phrase includes 
an operator, Lingo interprets only the first argument as part of the function, which may 
confuse Lingo. 

For example, the open wi ndow command allows one argument that specifies which window to 
open. If you use the & operator to define a pathname and filename, Director interprets only the 
string before the & operator as the filename. For example, Lingo interprets the statement open 
window the appl i cati onPath & "theMovie" as (open window the appl i cati onPath) & 

(" theMovi e" ). Avoid this problem by placing parentheses around the entire phrase that includes 
an operator, as follows: 

-- Lingo syntax 

open window (the applicationPath & "theMovie") 

// JavaScript syntax 

window(the applicationPath + "theMovie").open(); 

Example 

These statements use the grouping operator to change the order in which operations occur (the 
result appears below each statement): 

-- Lingo syntax 

put((2 + 3) * (4 + 5)) 

-- 45 

put(2 + (3 * (4 + 5))) 

-- 29 

put(2 +3*4+5) 

-- 19 


596 Chapter 13: Operators 



// JavaScript syntax 
put((2 + 3) * (4 + 5)); 
// 45 

put(2 + (3 * (4 + 5))); 
// 29 

put(2 +3*4+5); 

// 19 


* (multiplication) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

express ionl * express!on2 

// JavaScript syntax 
express!onl * express!on2 

Description 

Math operator; performs an arithmetic multiplication on two numerical expressions. If both 
expressions are integers, the product is an integer. If either or both expressions are floating-point 
numbers, the product is a floating-point number. 

This is an arithmetic operator with a precedence level of 4. 

Example 

This statement multiplies the integers 2 and 3 and displays the result in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(2 * 3) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(2 * 3); 

The result is 6, which is an integer. 

This statement multiplies the floating-point numbers 2.0 and 3.1414 and displays the result in 
the Message window; 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(2.0 * 3.1416) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(2.0 * 3.1416); 

The result is 6.2832, which is a floating-point number. 


(multiplication) 597 



+ (addition) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
express!onl + express!on2 

// JavaScript syntax 
express!onl + express!on2 

Description 

Math operator; performs an arithmetic sum on two numerical expressions. If both expressions are 
integers, the sum is an integer. If either or both expressions are floating-point numbers, the sum is 
a floating-point number. 

This is an arithmetic operator with a precedence level of 4. 

Example 

This statement adds the integers 2 and 3 and then displays the result, 5, an integer, in the 
Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(2 + 3) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(2 + 3); 

This statement adds the floating-point numbers 2.5 and 3.25 and displays the result, 5.7500, a 
floating-point number, in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(2.5 + 3.25) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(2.5 + 3.25); 

+ (addition) (3D) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
vector1 + vector2 
vector + sea 1ar 

II JavaScript syntax 
vectorl + vector2 
vector + sea 1ar 

Description 

3D vector operator; adds the components of two vectors, or adds the scalar value to each 
component of the vector and returns a new vector. 

vectorl + vector2 adds the components of vectorl to the corresponding to components of 
vector2 and returns a new vector. 

vectors- scalar adds the scalar value to each of the components of the vector and returns a 
new vector. 


598 Chapter 13: Operators 



- (subtraction) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
vectorl - vector2 
vector - scalar 

// JavaScript syntax 
vectorl - vector2 
vector - scalar 

Description 

3D vector operator; subtracts the components of vector2 from the corresponding components 
of vectorl, or subtracts the scalar value from each of the components and returns a new vector. 

vectorl - vector2 subtracts the values of vector2 from the corresponding components in 
vectorl and returns a new vector. 

vector - scalar subtracts the value of the scalar from each of the components in the vector and 
returns a new vector. 

* (multiplication) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
vectorl * vector2 
vector * scalar 
transform * vector 

II JavaScript syntax 
vectorl * vector2 
vector * scalar 
transform * vector 

Description 

3D vector operator; multiplies the components of vectorl by the corresponding components in 
vector2, and returns the dot product, or multiplies each of the components the vector by the 
scalar value and returns a new vector. 

vectorl * vector2 returns the dot product of the two vectors, which is not a new vector. This 
operation is the same as vectorl. dotproduct. vector2. 

vector* scalar multiplies each of the components in the vector by the scalar value and returns 
a new vector. 

transform* vector multiplies the transform by the vector and returns a new vector. The new 
vector is the result of applying the positional and rotational changes defined by transform to the 
vector. Note that vector * transform is not supported.

(multiplication) 599 




/ (division) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
express!onl / express!on2 

// JavaScript syntax 
express!onl / express!on2 

Description 

Math operator; performs an arithmetic division on two numerical expressions, dividing 
expression! by express! on2. If both expressions are integers, the quotient is an integer. If 
either or both expressions are floating-point numbers, the quotient is a floating-point number. 

This is an arithmetic operator with a precedence level of 4. 

Example 

This statement divides the integer 22 by 7 and then displays the result in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(22 / 7) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(22 / 7); 

The result is 3. Because both numbers in the division are integers, Lingo rounds the answer down 
to the nearest integer. 

This statement divides the floating-point number 22.0 by 7.0 and then displays the result in the 
Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(22.0 / 7.0) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(22.0 / 7.0); 

The result is 3.1429, which is a floating-point number.

[ ] (bracket access) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

textExpressi on\_ chunkN umber Be i ng Addressed] 
textExpressi on[fi rstChunk. . 1 astChunk~\ 

Description 

Operator; allows a chunk expression to be addressed by number. Useful for finding the wth 
chunk in the expression. The chunk can be a word, line, character, paragraph, or other Text cast 
member chunk. 

Example 

This outputs the first word of the third line in the text cast member First Names: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(member("First Names").text.line[3].word[l])

put(member("First Names").getPropRef("1 i ne", 1).getProp("word", 1)); 

[ ] (list) 

Usage 

lentryl, entry2, entry3, ...] 

Description 

List operator; specifies that the entries within the brackets are one of four types of lists: 

• Unsorted linear lists 

• Sorted linear lists 

• Unsorted property lists 

• Sorted property lists 


[ ] (list) 603 



Each entry in a linear list is a single value that has no other property associated with it. Each entry 
in a property list consists of a property and a value. The property appears before the value and is 
separated from the value by a colon. You cannot store a property in a linear list. When using 
strings as entries in a list, enclose the string in quotation marks. 

For example, [6, 3, 8] is a linear list. The numbers have no properties associated with them. 
However, [#gears:6, #balls:3, #ramps:8] is a property list. Each number has a property—in this 
case, a type of machinery—associated with it. This property list could be useful for tracking the 
number of each type of machinery currently on the Stage in a mechanical simulation. Properties 
can appear more than once in a property list. 

Lists can be sorted in alphanumeric order. A sorted linear list is ordered by the values in the list. A 
sorted property list is ordered by the properties in the list. You sort a list by using the appropriate 
command for a linear list or property list. 

• In linear lists, symbols and strings are case sensitive. 

• In property lists, symbols aren’t case-sensitive, but strings are case-sensitive. 

A linear list or property list can contain no values at all. An empty list consists of two square 
brackets ([ ]). To create or clear a linear list, set the list to [ ]. To create or clear a property list, set 
the list to [:]. 

You can modify, test, or read items in a list. 

Lingo treats an instance of a list as a reference to the list. This means each instance is the same 
piece of data, and changing it will change the original. Use the duplicate command to create 
copies of lists. 

Lists are automatically disposed when they are no longer referred to by any variable. When a list is 
held within a global variable, it persists from movie to movie. 

You can initialize a list in the on prepa reMovi e handler or write the list as a field cast member, 
assign the list to a variable, and then handle the list by handling the variable. 

Not all PC keyboards have square brackets. If square brackets aren’t available, use the list 
function to create a linear list. 

For a property list, create the list pieces as a string before converting them into a useful list. 

myListString = numToChar(91) & & numToChar(93) 

put myListString 
-- 

myList = my Li stStri ng . val ue 
put myList 
-- [:] 

put my List.1istP 
-- 1 

my List[#name] = "Brynn" 
put myList 
-- [#name: "Brynn"] 

Example 

This statement defines a list by making the machinery variable equal to the list: 

-- Lingo syntax 

machinery = [#gears:6, #balls:3, #ramps:8] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var machinery = propList("gears",6, "balls",3, "ramps",8); 


604 Chapter 13: Operators 



This handler sorts the list aList and then displays the result in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on sortList aList 
alist.sort() 
putCaLi st) 
end sortList 

// JavaScript syntax 
function sortList(aList) { 
aList.sort(); 
put(aLi st); 


If the movie issues the statement sortLi st machi nery, where machi nery is the list in the 
preceding example, the result is [#balls:3, #gears:6, #ramps:8]. 

The following statements create an empty linear list: 

-- Lingo syntax 
x = [ ] 
x = 1ist() 

// JavaScript syntax 
var x = 1ist(); 

The following statements create an empty property list: 

-- Lingo syntax 
x = I : 1 

x = propList() 

// JavaScript syntax 
var x = propList();

@ (pathname) 

Usage 

@pathReference 

Description 

Pathname operator; defines the path to the current movie’s folder and is valid on both Windows 
and Macintosh computers. 

Identify the current movies folder by using the @ symbol followed by one of these pathname 
separators: 

• / (forward slash) 

• \ (backslash) 

• : (colon) 

When a movie is queried to determine its location, the string returned will include the @ symbol. 


@ (pathname) 605 





Be sure to use only the @ symbol when navigating between Director movies or changing the 
source of a linked media cast member. The @ symbol does not work when the Fileio Xtra 
extension or other functions are used outside those available within Director. 

You can build on this pathname to specify folders that are one or more levels above or below the 
current movie’s folder. Keep in mind that the @ portion represents the current movie’s location, 
not necessarily the location of the projector. 

• Add an additional pathname separator immediately after the @ symbol to specify a folder one 
level up in the hierarchy. 

• Add folder names and filenames (separated by /, \, or :) after the current folder name to 
specify subfolders and files within folders. 

You can use relative pathnames in Lingo to indicate the location of a linked file in a folder 
different than the movie’s folder. 

Example 

These are equivalent expressions that specify the subfolder bigFolder, which is in the current 
movie’s folder: 

@/bigFolder 
bigFolder 
@\bigFolder 

These are equivalent expressions that specify the file linkedFile, in the subfolder bigFolder, which 
is in the current movie’s folder: 

@: bi gFol der: 1 inked File 
@\bi gFol der\l i nkedFi 1 e 
@/bi gFol der/1 i nkedFi 1 e 

This expression specifies the file linkedFile, which is located one level up from the current 
movie’s folder: 

@//linkedFi1e 

This expression specifies the file linkedFile, which is located two levels up from the current 
movie’s folder: 

@:::1inkedFi1e 

These are equivalent expressions that specify the file linkedFile, which is in the folder otherFolder. 
The otherFolder folder is in the folder one level up from the current movie’s folder. 

@: :otherFolder:linkedFi1e 
@\\otherFol der\linkedFi1e 
@//otherFol der/1inkedFi1e

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

1ogicalExpressionl and 7 ogical Express!on2 
// JavaScript syntax 

7 ogical Express!onl && 7 ogical Express!on2 

Description 

Logical operator; determines whether both 7 ogica 1 Express ionl and 7 ogica 1 Express ion2 are 
TRUE (1), or whether either or both expressions are FALSE (0). 

The precedence level of this logical operator is 4. 

Example 

This statement determines whether both logical expressions are TRUE and displays the result in the 
Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(1 < 2 and 2 < 3) 

// JavaScript syntax 

putC(1 < 2) && (2 < 3)); 

The result is 1, which is the numerical equivalent of TRUE. 

The first logical expression in the following statement is TRU E; and the second logical expression is 
FALSE. Because both logical expressions are not TRUE, the logical operator displays the result 0, 
which is the numerical equivalent of FALSE. 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(l < 2 and 2 < 1) 

-- 0 

// JavaScript syntax 
put((1 < 2) && (2 < 1)); 

// 0

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

stringExpressionl contains stringExpression2 
II JavaScript syntax 

stringExpressionl .indexOf (stringExpression2 ); 

Description 

Operator; compares two strings and determines whether stri ngExpressi onl contains 
stri ngExpressi on2 (TRUE) or not (FALSE). 

The contai ns comparison operator has a precedence level of 1. 


contains 607 



The contains comparison operator is useful for checking whether the user types a specific 
character or string of characters. You can also use the conta i ns operator to search one or more 
fields for specific strings of characters. 

Example 

This example determines whether a character passed to it is a digit: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on isNumber aLetter 
digits = "1234567890" 
if digits contains aLetter then 
return TRUE 
el se 

return FALSE 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function isNumber(aLetter) { 
var digits = "1234567890" 
if (digi ts. i ndex0f(a Letter) >= 0) 1 
return true; 

! else 1 

return false: 


Note: The string comparison is not sensitive to case or diacritical marks; “a” and A are treated 
the same.

offset!) (string function), starts 

mod 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

integerExpressionl mod 7 ntegerExpression2 

// JavaScript syntax 
integerExpressionl l integerExpression2 

Description 

Math operator; performs the arithmetic modulus operation on two integer expressions. In this 
operation, integerExpressionl is divided by integerExpression2. 

The resulting value of the entire expression is the integer remainder of the division. It always has 
the sign of integerExpressionl. 

This is an arithmetic operator with a precedence level of 4. 

Example 

This statement divides 7 by 4 and then displays the remainder in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(7 mod 4) 


608 Chapter 13: Operators 




// JavaScript syntax 
put(7 % 4) ; 

The result is 3. 

The following handler sets the ink effect of all odd-numbered sprites to copy, which is the ink 
effect specified by the number 0. First the handler checks whether the sprite in the variable 
mySpri te is an odd-numbered sprite by dividing the sprite number by 2 and then checking 
whether the remainder is 1. If the remainder is 1, the result for an odd-numbered number, the 
handler sets the ink effect to copy. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on setlnk 

repeat with mySprite = 1 to _movie.1astChannel 
if (mySprite mod 2) = 1 then 
sprite(mySprite).ink = 0 
el se 

sprite(mySprite). i nk = 8 
end i f 
end repeat 
end setlnk 

// JavaScript syntax 
function setlnkO { 

for (mySprite=l; mySprite<=_movie.1astChannel; mySprite++) { 
if ((mySprite % 2) == 1) { 
sprite(mySprite).ink = 0; 

} else {

This handler regularly cycles a sprite’s cast member among a number of bitmaps: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame 

global gCounter 

-- These are sample values for bitmap cast member numbers 
theBitmaps = [2,3,4,5,6,7] 

-- Specify which sprite channel is affected 
theChannel = 1 

-- This cycles through the list 

gCounter = 1 + (gCounter mod theBitmaps.count) 

sprite(theChannel).memberNum = theBitmaps[gCounter] 

_movie.go(_movie.frame) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFrameO ( 

// these are sample values for bitmap cast member numbers 
theBitmaps = new Array(2,3,4,5,6,7); 

// specify which sprite channel is affected 
theChannel = 1; 

// this cycles through the list 

_global.gCounter = 1 + (_global.gCounter % theBitmaps.1ength); 

sprite(theChannel).memberNum = theBitmaps[_g1obal.gCounter]; 

_movie.go(_movie.frame); 


mod 609 



not 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
not 1 ogical Express!on 

// JavaScript syntax 
! 1 ogical Expression 

Description 

Operator; performs a logical negation on a logical expression. This is the equivalent of making a 
TRUE value FALSE, and making a FALSE value TRUE. It is useful when testing to see if a certain 
known condition is not the case. 

This logical operator has a precedence level of 5. 

Example 

This statement determines whether 1 is not less than 2: 

-- Lingo syntax 
putlnot (1 < 2)) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(!(1 < 2)); 

Because 1 is less than 2, the result is 0, which indicates that the expression is FALSE. 

This statement determines whether 1 is not greater than 2: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(not (1 > 2)) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(!(1 > 2)); 

Because 1 is not greater than 2, the result is 1, which indicates that the expression is TRUE. 

This handler sets the checkMa rk menu item property for Bold in the Style menu to the opposite 
of its current setting: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on resetMenuItem 

menu("Styl e").menultem!"Bold").checkMark = \ 
not (menu("Style").menultem("Bold").checkMark) 
end resetMenuItem 

// JavaScript syntax 
function resetMenuItem!) { 

menu!"Styl e").menultem!"Bold").checkMark = 

!(menu!"Styl e").menultem!"Bol d").checkMark)

or 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

1ogical Express!onl or 7 ogical Express!on2 
// JavaScript syntax 

1ogical Express!onl || 1ogical Express!on2 

Description 

Operator; performs a logical OR operation on two or more logical expressions to determine 
whether any expression is TRUE. 

This is a logical operator with a precedence level of 4. 

Example 

This statement indicates in the Message window whether at least one of the expressions 1 < 2 and 
1 > 2 is TRUE: 

-- Lingo syntax 

putC(1 < 2) or (1 > 2)) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(C1 < 2) || (1 > 2)); 

Because the first expression is TRUE, the result is 1, which is the numerical equivalent of TRUE. 

This Lingo checks whether the content of the field cast member named State is either AK or HI 
and displays an alert if it is: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if member!"State").text = "AK" or member!"State").text = "HI" then 
_player.alert("You're off the map!") 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 

if (member!"State").text == "AK" || member!"State").text == "HI”) ( 

_player.alert!"You’re off the map!");

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
string1 starts string2 

II JavaScript syntax 

stringl.indexOf(string2) == 0; 

Description 

Operator; compares to determines whether stringl starts with string2 (TRUE or 1) or not 
(FALSE or 0). 

The string comparison is not sensitive to case or diacritical marks; a and A are considered to be 
the same. 

This is a comparison operator with a precedence level of 1. 

Example 

This statement reports in the Message window whether the word Macromedia starts with the 
string “Macro”: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put("Macromedia" starts "Macro") 

// JavaScript syntax 

var stringl = "Macromedia"; 

putlstringl.index0f("Macro") == 0); 

The result is 1, which is the numerical equivalent of TRUE.

actorList 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.actor List 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.actor List; 

Description 

Movie property; a list of child objects that have been explicitly added to this list. Read/write. 

Objects in actorLi st receive a stepFrame message each time the playhead enters a frame. 

To add an object to the actorList, use _movi e.actorList.append! newScriptObjRef). The 
object’s stepFrame handler in its parent or ancestor script will then be called automatically at 
each frame advance. 

To clear objects from the actorLi st, set actorLi st to [ ], which is an empty list. 

Director doesn’t clear the contents of actorList when branching to another movie, which can 
cause unpredictable behavior in the new movie. To prevent child objects in the current movie 
from being carried over to the new movie, insert the statement actorList = [ ]in the 
prepa reMovi e handler of the new movie. 

Example 

This statement adds a child object created from the parent script Moving Ball. All three values are 
parameters that the script requires. 

This statement displays the contents of actorList in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(_movie.actorLi st) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(_movie.actorList); 

This statement clears objects from actorList. 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.actor List = [] -- using brackets 
_movie.actor List = list!) -- using list!) 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.actor List = list!);

alertHook 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_player.alertHook 

// JavaScript syntax 
_player.alertHook; 

Description 

Player property; specifies a parent script that contains the al ertHook handler. Read/write. 

Use alertHook to control the display of alerts about file errors or script errors. When an error 
occurs and a parent script is assigned to al ertHook, Director runs the al ertHook handler in the 
parent script. 

Although it is possible to place al ertHook handlers in movie scripts, it is strongly recommended 
that you place an alertHook handler in a behavior or parent script to avoid unintentionally 
calling the handler from a wide variety of locations and creating confusion about where the 
error occurred. 

Because the al ertHook handler runs when an error occurs, avoid using the al ertHook handler 
for script that isn't involved in handling an error. For example, the al ertHook handler is a bad 
location for a go( ) statement. 

The al ertHook handler is passed an instance argument, two string arguments that describe the 
error, and an optional argument specifying an additional event that invokes the handler. 

The fourth argument can have 1 of these 4 values: 

• #al ert —causes the handler to be triggered by the al ert( ) method. 

• #movi e —causes the handler to be triggered by a file not found error while performing a go() 
command. 

• #scri pt —causes the handler to be triggered by a script error. 

• #safepl ayer —causes the handler to be triggered by a check of the safePl ayer property. 

Depending on the script within it, the alertHook handler can ignore the error or report it in 
another way. 

Example 

The following statement specifies that the parent script Alert is the script that determines whether 
to display alerts when an error occurs. If an error occurs, the script assigns the error and message 
strings to the field cast member Output and returns the value 1. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on prepareMovie 

_player.alertHook = script("Alert") 
end 

-- "Alert" script 
on alertHook me, err, msg 

member!"Output").text = err && msg 
return 1 
end

alignment 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef .al i gnment 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef .al i gnment; 

Description 

Cast member property; determines the alignment used to display characters within the specified 
cast member. This property appears only to field and text cast members containing characters, if 
only a space. 

For field cast members, the value of the property is a string consisting of one of the following: left, 
center, or right.

ambient 

Usage 

member! uhichCastmember) .shader! whichShader ).ambient 
member! whichCastmember ).model (whichModel) .shader.ambient 
member! whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel ).shaderLi st{[ index ]}.\ 
ambient 

Description 

3D #s t a n d a r d shader property; indicates how much of each color component of the ambient 
light in the cast member is reflected by the shader. 


626 Chapter 14: Properties 



For example, if the color of the ambient light is rgb( 255, 255, 255 ) and the value of the 
ambient property of the shader is rgb(255, 0, 0), the shader will reflect all of the red 
component of the light that the shader’s colors can reflect. However, it will reflect none of the 
blue and green components of the light, regardless of the colors of the shader. In this case, if there 
are no other lights in the scene, the blue and green colors of the shader will reflect no light, and 
will appear black. 

The default value of this property is rgb(63,63,63). 

Example 

This statement sets the ambient property of the model named Chair torgb(255, 255, 0). 
Chair will fully reflect the red and green components of the ambient light in the scene and 
completely ignore its blue component. 

member("Room").model("Chair").shader.ambient = rgb(255 , 0, 0) 

See also 

ambientColor , newLight, type (light), diffuse, specular (shader) 

ambientColor 

Usage 

membert uhichCastmember). ambi entCol or 

Description 

3D cast member property; indicates the RGB color of the default ambient light of the 
cast member. 

The default value for this property is rgb(0, 0, 0). This adds no light to the scene. 

Example 

This statement sets the ambi entCol or property of the cast member named Room to rgb(255, 0, 
0). The default ambient light of the cast member will be red. This property can also be set in the 
Property inspector. 

member("Room").ambientColor = rgb(255, 0, 0)

ancestor 

Usage 

property [optionalProperties] ancestor 

Description 

Object property; allows child objects and behaviors to use handlers that are not contained within 
the parent script or behavior. 

The ancestor property is typically used with two or more parent scripts. You can use this 
property when you want child objects and behaviors to share certain behaviors that are inherited 
from an ancestor, while differing in other behaviors that are inherited from the parents. 


ancestor 627 



For child objects, the ancestor property is usually assigned in the on new handler within the 
parent script. Sending a message to a child object that does not have a defined handler forwards 
that message to the script defined by the ancestor property. 

If a behavior has an ancestor, the ancestor receives mouse events such as mouseDown and 
mouseWi thi n. 

The ancestor property lets you change behaviors and properties for a large group of objects with 
a single command. 

The ancestor script can contain independent property variables that can be obtained by child 
objects. To refer to property variables within the ancestor script, you must use this syntax: 

me. propertyVari abl e = value 

For example, this statement changes the property variable 1 egCount within an ancestor script 
to 4: 

me . 1egCount = 4 

Use the syntax the variableName of s cr i ptName to access property variables that are not 
contained within the current object. This statement allows the variable my LegCount within the 
child object to access the property variable 1 egCount within the ancestor script: 

set myLegCount to the legCount of me 

Example 

Each of the following scripts is a cast member. The ancestor script Animal and the parent scripts 
Dog and Man interact with one another to define objects. 

The first script, Dog, sets the property variable breed to Mutt, sets the ancestor of Dog to the 
Animal script, and sets the legCount variable that is stored in the ancestor script to 4: 

property breed, ancestor 
on new me 

set breed = "Mutt" 

set the ancestor of me to new(script "Animal") 

set the legCount of me to 4 

return me 
end 

The second script, Man, sets the property variable race to Caucasian, sets the ancestor of Man 
to the Animal script, and sets the 1 egCount variable that is stored in the ancestor script to 2: 

property race, ancestor 
on new me 

set race to "Caucasian" 

set the ancestor of me to new(script "Animal") 

set the legCount of me to 2 

return me 
end

angle (3D) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model Resource( whichModelResource). \ 
emitter.angle 

Description 

3D emitter property; describes the area into which the particles of a particle system are emitted. 
A particle system is a model resource whose type is #pa rti cl e. 

The primary direction of particle emission is the vector set by the emitters di recti on property. 
However, the direction of emission of a given particle will deviate from that vector by a random 
angle between 0 and the value of the emitter’s angle property. 

The effective range of this property is 0.0 to 180.0. The default value is 180.0. 

Example 

This statement sets the angle of emission of the model resource named mrFount to 1, which 
causes the emitted particles to form a thin line. 

member("fountain").model Resource!"mrFount").emitter.angle = 1

member("Scene").animationEnabled = FALSE 

antiAlias 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. anti Alias 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. antiAlias; 


630 Chapter 14: Properties 



Description 


Cast member property; controls whether a text, Vector shape, or Flash cast member is rendered 
using anti-aliasing to produce high-quality rendering, but possibly slower playback of the movie. 
The anti Alias property is TRUE by default. 

For vector shapes, TRUE is the equivalent of the #hi gh quality setting for a Flash asset, and FALSE 
is the equivalent of #1 ow. 

The anti A1 i as property may also be used as a sprite property only for Vector shape sprites. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This behavior checks the color depth of the computer on which the movie is playing. If the 
color depth is set to 8 bits or less (256 colors), the script sets the anti Alias property of the 
sprite to FALSE. 

--Lingo syntax 
property spriteNum 

on beginsprite me 

if _system.col orDepth <= 8 then 

sprite(spriteNum).anti A1 i as = FALSE 
end i f

antiAliasingEnabled 

Usage 

sprite! whichSprite) .antiA1 iasingEnabl ed 

Description 

3D sprite property; indicates whether the 3D world in the sprite whichSpri te is anti-aliased. It 
can be tested and set. The default value is FALSE, indicating that anti-aliasing is off. If the 
antiAliasingEnabled property is set to T R U E and the 3 D Tenderer changes to a Tenderer that 
does not support anti-aliasing, the property is set to FALSE. The value of this property is not saved 
when the movie is saved. 

Anti-aliased sprites use more processor power and memory than sprites that are not anti-aliased. 
Temporarily turning off anti-aliasing can improve the performance of animations and user 
interaction. 


antiAliasingEnabled 631 



Example 

This Lingo checks whether the currently running 3D Tenderer for sprite 2 supports anti-aliasing 
with the anti A1 i asi ngSupported property. If anti-aliasing is supported, the second statement 
turns on anti-aliasing for the sprite with the anti A1 i asi ngEnabl ed property. 

if sprite(2).antiA1iasingSupported = TRUE then 
sprite(2).antiA1iasingEnabled = TRUE 
end i f

a linear transition to the currently playing motion from the motion that preceded it (TRUE) or 
not (FALSE). If autoBl end is TRUE, the length of the transition is set by the bl endTi me property 
of the modifier. If autoBlend is FALSE, the transition is controlled by the blendFactor property 
of the modifier and bl endT i me is ignored. 

Motion blending is completely disabled when bl endTi me is set to 0 and autoBl end is set 
to TRUE. 

The default value of this property is TRUE. 

Example 

This statement turns autoblend off for the model named Alien3. The model’s blendFactor 
setting will be used for blending successive motions in the playlist. 

member("newaliens").model("A1ien3").keyframePlayer.\ 
autoblend = FALSE

autoCameraPosition 

Usage 

member( whichTextCastmember ).autoCameraPosition 

Description 

3D camera property; indicates whether the camera of the 3D text cast member is automatically 
positioned to show all of the text (TRUE) or not (FALSE). This is useful when changing the text, 
font, fontsize, and other properties of the cast member. 

This property is not valid with other types of 3D cast members. 


642 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 


This statement sets the autoCameraPosi ti on property of the cast member named Headline to 
FALSE. When the cast member is displayed in 3D mode, the camera will not be positioned 
automatically. 

member("Headline").autoCameraPosition = FALSE

displayMode 

autoMask 

Usage 

member( whichCursorCastMember ).autoMask 
the autoMask of member whichCastMember 

Description 

Cast member property; specifies whether the white pixels in the animated color cursor cast 
member whi chCursorCastMember are transparent, allowing the background to show through 
(TRUE, default), or opaque (FALSE). 

Example 

In this script, when the custom animated cursor stored in cast member 5 enters the sprite, the 
automask is turned on so that the background of the sprite will show through the white pixels. 
When the cursor leaves the sprite, the automask is turned off. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseEnter 

member 5.autoMask = TRUE 
end 

on mouseLeave 

member 5.autoMask = FALSE 
end 

Using traditional Lingo syntax, the script is written as: 

on mouseEnter 

set the autoMask of member 5 = TRUE 
end 

on mouseLeave 

set the autoMask of member 5 = FALSE 
end 


autoMask 643 



autoTab 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef .autoTab 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. autoTab; 

Description 

Cast member property; determines the effect that pressing the Tab key has on the editable field or 
text cast member specified by whi chCastMember. The property can be made active (TRUE) or 
inactive (FALSE). Tabbing order depends on sprite number order, not position on the Stage. 

Example 

This statement causes the cast member Comments to automatically advance the insertion point 
to the next editable field or text sprite after the user presses Tab. 

--Lingo syntax 

member C"Comments").autotab = TRUE 

// JavaScript syntax 

member C"Comments").autotab = true; 

axisAngle 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel ).transform.axi sAngl e 
member( whichCastmember). camera( whichCamera) .transform.axisAngl e 
member! whichCastmember). 1 ight( whichLight). transform.axi sAngl e 
member! whichCastmember). group! whichGroup) .transform. axi sAngl e 
transformReference.axisAngl e 

Description 

3D transform property; describes the transform’s rotation as an axis/angle pair. 

The axi sAngl e property is a linear list containing a vector (the axis) and a float (the angle). 

The vector is the axis around which the transform is rotated. The float is the amount, in degrees, 
of rotation. 

The default value of this property is [vector! 1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000 ), 0.0000]. 

Example 

This statement shows the rotation of the model named Mailbox as an axisAngle. The model is 
rotated 145.5 degrees counterclockwise about the y axis. 

put member!"Yard").model("Mailbox").transform.axisAngle 
-- [vector! 0.0000, 1.0000, 0.0000 ), -145.5000]

back 


Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource( whichModelResource ).back 

Description 

3D it box model resource property; indicates whether the side of the box intersected by its +Z axis 
is sealed (TRUE) or open (FALSE). 

The default value for this property is TRUE. 

Example 

This statement sets the back property of the model resource named Crate to FALSE, meaning the 
back of this box will be open. 

member("3D World").model Resource!"Crate").back = FALSE

backColor 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spri teObjRef. backCol or 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. backCol or ; 

Description 

Sprite property; sets the background color of a specified sprite according to the color value 
assigned. Read/write. 

Setting backColor of a sprite is the same as choosing the background color from the Tool palette 
when the sprite is selected on the Stage. For the value that a script sets to last beyond the current 
sprite, the sprite must be a scripted sprite. The background color applies to all bitmap cast 
members, in addition to field, button, check box, and radio cast members. 

The backCol or value ranges from 0 to 255 for 8-bit color and from 0 to 15 for 4-bit color. 

The numbers correspond to the index number of the background color in the current palette. 

(A color’s index number appears in the color palettes lower left corner when you click the color.) 

If this property is set on bitmap cast members that are deeper than 1-bit, the backColor may not 
be seen if the background of the bitmap is not visible. 

If the blend of a sprite is less than 100 but greater than 0, the backCol or will mix with the 
transparent colors. 

Note: It is recommended that the newer bgCol or property be used instead of the backCol or property. 


backColor 645 



Example 


The following statement sets the variable ol dCol or to the background color of sprite 5: 

-- Lingo syntax 

oldColor = spri te( 5). backCol or 

// JavaScript syntax 

var oldColor = spri te( 5). backCol or ; 

The following statement randomly changes the background color of a random sprite between 
sprites 11 and 13 to color number 36: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(10 + random(3)).backColor = 36 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(10 + random(3)).backColor = 36:

Description 

3D camera property; a 2D image that is rendered on the camera’s projection plane. All models in 
the cameras view appear in front of the backdrop. 

Backdrops have the following properties: 

Note: These properties can also be used to get, set, and manipulate overlays. For detailed 
information, see the individual property entries. 

loc (backdrop and overlay) indicates the 2D location of the backdrop, as measured from the 
upper left corner of the sprite. 

source indicates the texture used by the backdrop. 

scale (backdrop and overlay) is the number by which the height and width of the texture are 
multiplied to determine the dimensions of the backdrop. 


646 Chapter 14: Properties 



rotation (backdrop and overlay) is the amount by which the backdrop is rotated about its 
regPoint. 

regPoint (3D) indicates the registration point of the backdrop, 
blend (3D) indicates the opacity of the backdrop. 

count (3D) indicates the number of items in the camera’s list of backdrops. 

Use the following commands to create and remove backdrops: 

addBackdrop creates a backdrop from a texture and adds it to the end of the camera’s list of 
backdrops. 

insertBackdrop creates a backdrop from a texture and adds it to the camera’s list of backdrops at 
a specific index position. 

removeBackdrop deletes the backdrop.

bevelDepth 

Usage 

member( whichTextCastmember ).bevel Depth 

member( uhich3DCastmember ).model Resource( whichModelResource).\ 
bevel Depth 

Description 

3D text property; indicates the degree of beveling on the 3D text. 

For text cast members, this property has no effect unless the member’s di spl ayMode property is 
set to #mode3D and its bevel Type property is set to #mi ter or #round. 

For extruded text in a 3D cast member, this property has no effect unless the model resource’s 
bevel Type property is set to #mi ter or #round. 

The range of this property is 0.0 to 10.0, and the default setting is 10.0. 

Example 

In this example, the cast member named Logo is a text cast member. This statement sets the 
bevel Depth of logo to 5.5. When logo is displayed in 3D mode, if its bevel Type property is set 
to #mi ter or # round, the edges of its letters will exhibit dramatic beveling. 

membert"Logo").bevel Depth = 5.5 

In this example, the model resource of the model named Slogan is extruded text. This statement 
sets the bevel Depth of Slogan’s model resource to 5. If the bevel Type property of Slogan is set to 
#mi ter or #round, the edges ofits letters will exhibit dramatic beveling. 

member("scene").model("SIogan").resource.bevel Depth = 5

(the stage).bgColor 

member( which3dMember ).bgcol or 

Description 

Sprite property, system property, and 3D cast member property; determines the background color 
of the sprite specified by wh i chSpr i te, the color of the Stage, or the background color of the 3D 
cast member. Setting the bgColor sprite property is equivalent to choosing the background color 
from the Tools window when the sprite is selected on the Stage. Setting the bgColor property for 
the Stage is equivalent to setting the color in the Movie Properties dialog box. 

The sprite property has the equivalent functionality of the backCol or sprite property, but the 
color value returned is a color object of whatever type has been set for that sprite. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This example sets the color of the Stage to an RGB value. 

Dot syntax: 

(the stage).bgCoior = rgb(255, 153, 0)

bias 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel ). 1 od.bias 

Description 

3D 1 od modifier property; indicates how aggressively the modifier removes detail from the model 
when its auto property is set to TRUE. This property has no effect when the modifier’s auto 
property is set to FALSE . 

The range for this property is from 0.0 (removes all polygons) to +100.0 (removes no polygons). 
The default setting is 100.0. 


650 Chapter 14: Properties 



The #1 od modifier can only be added to models created outside of Director in 3D modeling 
programs. The value of the type property of the model resources used by these models is 
#f romFi 1 e. The modifier cannot be added to primitives created within Director. 

Example 

This statement sets the bias property of the 1 o d modifier of the model named Spaceship to 10. If 
the 1 od modifier’s auto property is set to TRUE, the modifier will very aggressively lower the level 
of detail of Spaceship as it moves away from the camera.

member( whichCastmember) .shader( whichShader ).blendConstant 
member! whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel) .shader.blendConstant 
member! whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel) .shaderListlt index ]}.\ 
blendConstant 

Description 

3D #standard shader property; indicates the blending ratio used for the first texture layer of 
the shader. 

If the shader’s useDi ffuseWi thTexture property is set to TRUE, the texture blends with the 
color set by the shader’s di ffuse property. If useDi ffuseWi thTexture is FALSE, white is used 
for blending. 

Each of the other texture layers blends with the texture layer below it. Use the 
blendConstantList property to control blending in those texture layers. 

The blendConstant property works only when the shader’s blendSource property is set to 
#constant. For more information, see bl endSource and bl endSourceLi st. 

The range of this property is 0 to 100; the default is 50. 

Example 

In this example, the shader list of the model named MysteryBox contains six shaders. This 
statement sets the bl endConstant property of the second shader to 20. This property is affected 
by the settings of the bl endFuncti on, bl endFuncti onLi st, bl endSource, and

blendConstantList{[ index ]) 

Description 

3D #standa rd shader property; indicates the ratio used for blending a texture layer of the shader 
with the texture layer below it. 

The shader’s texture list and the blend constant list both have eight index positions. Each index 
position in the blend constant list controls blending for the texture at the corresponding index 
position in the texture list. You can set all index positions of the list to the same value at one time 
by not specifying the optional index parameter. Use the index parameter to set the list one index 
position at a time. 


654 Chapter 14: Properties 



The blendConstantList property works only when the blendSource property of the 
corresponding texture layer is set to ^constant. 

The range of this property is 0 to 100; the default is 50. 

Example 

In this example, the shader list of the model named MysteryBox contains six shaders. This 
statement shows the blendConstant property of each of the textures used by the second shader. 
This property is affected by the settings of the blendFunction, blendFunctionList, 
bl endSource, and bl endSourceLi st properties.

blendFactor 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel ).keyframe PI ayer.\ 
bl endFactor 

member! whichCastmember ).model (whichModel ).bones PI ayer.blendFactor 

Description 

3D keyf ramePl ayer and bonesPl ayer modifier property; indicates the amount by which a 
motion is combined with the motion that preceded it. 

The range of this property is 0 to 100, and the default value is 0. 

BlendFactor is used only when the autoblend property of the modifier is set to FALSE. If the 
value of the bl endFactor property is 100, the current motion will have none of the 
characteristics of the motion that preceded it. If the value of bl endFactor is 0, the current 
motion will have all of the characteristics of the motion that preceded it and none of its own. If 
the value ofblendFactoris50, the current motion will be a synthesis equally composed of its 
own characteristics and those of the motion that preceded it. The value bl endFactor can be 
varied over time to create transitions unlike the linear transition created when the modifiers 
autobl end property is set to TRUE. 

Example 

This statement sets the bl endFactor property of model Alien3 to 50. If the modifier’s 
autobl end property is FALSE, each motion in the playlist of the keyf ramePl ayer for Alien3 will 
be an even mixture of itself and the motion that preceded it.

blendFunction 


Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .shader( whichShader ).blendFunction 
member! whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel ).shader.blendFunction 
member! whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel) ,shaderList{[ index ]}.\ 
blendFunction 

Description 

3D #standard shader property; indicates the type of blending used by the first texture layer of 
the shader. 

If the shader’s useDiffuseWithTexture property is set to TRUE, the texture blends with the color 
set by the shader’s di ft use property. If useDi f f useWi thTexture is FALSE, white is used for 
blending. 

Each of the other texture layers blends with the texture layer below it. Use the 
bl endFuncti onLi st property to control blending in those texture layers. 

The bl endFuncti on property can have the following values: 

#mul ti ply multiplies the RGB values of the texture layer by the color being used for blending 
(see above). 

#add adds the RGB values of the texture layer to the color being used for blending, and then 
clamps to 255. 

#repl ace prevents the texture from being blended with the color set by the shader’s 
diffuse property. 

#bl end combines the colors of the texture layer with the color being used for blending in the ratio 
set by the bl endConstant property. 

The default value of this property is #mul ti pi y. 

Example 

In this example, the shader list of the model named MysteryBox contains six shaders. This 
statement sets the bl endFuncti on property of the second shader to #bl end. This enables the 
settings of the bl endSource, bl endSourceList, bl endConstant, and bl endConstantLi st 
properties.

Usage 

memberiwhichCastmember) ,shader(w/j7 chShader) ,\ 
blendFunctionList{[ index ]} 
member! whichCastmember) .model (whi chModel) .shader.\ 
blendFunctionList{[ index ~\) 

member! whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel ) ,shaderList{[ index ]}.\ 
blendFunctionList{[ index ]} 

Description 

3D #standard shader property; a linear list that indicates the manner in which each texture layer 
blends with the texture layer below it. 

The shader’s texture list and blend function list both have eight index positions. Each index 
position in the blend function list controls blending for the texture at the corresponding index 
position in the texture list. You can set all index positions of the list to the same value at one time 
by not specifying the optional index parameter. Use the index parameter to set the list one index 
position at a time. 

Each index position of the blend function list can have one of the following values: 

#mu 11 i p 1 y multiplies the RGB values of the texture layer by the RGB values of the texture layer 
below it. 

#add adds the RGB values of the texture layer to the RGB values of the texture layer below it, and 
then clamps to 255. 

#repl ace causes the texture to cover the texture layer below it. No blending occurs. 

#bl end causes blending to be controlled by the value of the blendSource property, which allows 
alpha blending. 

The default value of this property is #mul ti pi y. 

Example 

In this example, the shaderList property of the model named MysteryBox contains six shaders. 
This statement shows that the value of the fourth index position of the bl endFuncti onLi st 
property of the second shader is set to #bl end. Blending of the fourth texture layer of the second 
shader of the model will be controlled by the settings of the bl endSource, bl endSourceLi st,

blendLevel 


Usage 

sprite( whichSpriteNumber ).blend Level 
the blendLevel of sprite whichSpriteNumber 

Description 

Sprite property; allows the current blending value of a sprite to be set or accessed. The possible 
range of values is from 0 to 255. This differs from the Sprite Inspector, which shows values in the 
range 0 to 100. The results are the same, the scales simply differ. 

This property is the equivalent of the blend sprite property. 

Example 

sprite C 3).blendlevel = 99

blendRange 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource( whichModelResource)\ 

.blendRange.start 

model ResourceObjectReference .bl end Range.end 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource( whichModelResource)\ 

.blendRange.start 

model ResourceObjectReference .bl end Range.end 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model resource whose type is #pa rti cl e, allows you to get or set 
the start and end of the model resource’s blend range. 

The opacity of particles in the system is interpolated linearly between blend Range.start and 
blend Range.end over the lifetime of each particle. 

This property’s value must be greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than or equal to 100.0. The 
default value for this property is 100.0. 

Example 

This statement sets the bl endRange properties of model resource ThermoSystem, which is of the 
type #particle. 

The first line sets the start value to 100, and the second line sets the end value to 0. The effect of 
this statement is that the particles of ThermoSystem are fully opaque when they first appear, and 
then gradually fade to transparent during their lifetime. 

member("Heater").model Resource!"ThermoSystem").blendRange.\ 
start = 100.0 

member("Heater").model Resource("ThermoSystem").blend Range.\

blendSource 


Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .shader( whichShader ).blendSource 
member! whichCastmember ).model (whichModel) .shader.blendSource 
member! whichCastmember ).model (whichModel) ,shaderList{[ index ]}.\ 
blendSource 

Description 

3D (/standard shader property; indicates whether blending of the first texture layer in the 
shader’s texture list is based on the texture’s alpha information or a constant ratio. 

If the shader’s useDiffuseWithTexture property is set to TRUE, the texture blends with the color 
set by the shader’s di ff use property. If useDi f f useWi thTexture is FALSE, white is used for 
blending. 

Each of the other texture layers blends with the texture layer below it. Use the blendSourceList 
property to control blending in those texture layers. 

The blendSource property works only when the shader’s blendFunction property is set to 
#blend. 

The possible values of this property are as follows: 

#al pha causes the alpha information in the texture to determine the blend ratio of each pixel of 
the texture with the color being used for blending (see above). 

(/constant causes the value of the shader’s blendConstant property to be used as the blend ratio 
for all the pixels of the texture. 

The default value of this property is (/constant. 

Example 

In this example, the shader list of the model named MysteryBox contains six shaders. This 
statement sets the blendSource property of the first texture used by the second shader to 
(/constant. This enables the settings of the bl endConstant and bl endConstantLi st properties.

blendSourceList 659 



Description 


3D #standard shader property; indicates whether blending of a texture layer with the texture 
layers below it is based on the texture’s alpha information or a constant ratio. 

The shader’s texture list and the blend source list both have eight index positions. Each index 
position in the blend source list controls blending for the texture at the corresponding index 
position in the texture list. You can set all index positions of the list to the same value at one time 
by not specifying the optional index parameter. Use the index parameter to set the list one index 
position at a time. 

The bl endSourceLi st property only works when the bl endFuncti on property of the 
corresponding texture layer is set to #bl end. See bl endFuncti on and bl endFuncti onLi st for 
more information. 

The possible values of this property are as follows: 

#al pha causes the alpha information in the texture to determine the blend ratio of each pixel of 
the texture layer with the layer below it. 

#constant causes the value of the blendConstant property of the corresponding texture layer to 
be used as the blend ratio for all of the pixels of the texture layer. See blendConstant and 
bl endConstantLi st for more information. 

The default value of this property is #constant. 

Example 

In this example, the shader list of the model MysteryBox contains six shaders. Each shader has a 
texture list that contains up to eight textures. This statement shows that the blendSource 
property of the fourth texture used by the second shader is set to #constant. This enables the 
settings of the bl endConstant, bl endConstantLi st, and useDi ft useWi thTexture properties.

blendTime 

Usage 

member( uhichCastmember) .model ( whichModel ) .keyframe PIayer.\ 
blendTime 

member( whichCastmember) .model( whichModel ) .bones PI ayer.bl endTi me 

Description 

3D keyf ramePl ayer and bonesPl ayer modifier property; determines the duration, in 
milliseconds, of the transition between motions in the playlist of the modifier for the model. 

The bl endTi me property works in conjunction with the modifier’s autoBl end property. When 
autoBl end is set to TRUE, the modifier creates a linear transition to the model’s currently playing 
motion from the motion that preceded it. The value of the bl endT i me property is the length of 
that transition. The bl endTi me property is ignored if autoBl end is set to FALSE. 

The default setting of this property is 500. 


660 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 

This statement sets the length of the transition between motions in the playlist of the modifier for 
the model named Alien5 to 1200 milliseconds.

bone[ index ].worldTransform 

Description 

3D element; a bone is structural element of a model resource authored in a 3D modeling 
program. Bones cannot be created, deleted, or rearranged in Director. 

Bones (#bones) motions, which also must be scripted in a 3D modeling program, act upon the 
bone structure of a model resource, and are managed in Director by the bonesPl ayer modifier. 

See also 

count (3D), bonesPlayer (modifier), transform (property), worldTransform 

bonesPlayer (modifier) 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember ).model (whichModel). 
bonesPl ayer .whichBonesPlayerProperty 

Description 

3D modifier; manages the use of motions by models. The motions managed by the bonesPl ayer 
modifier animate segments, called bones, of the model. 

Motions and the models that use them must be created in a 3D modeling program, exported as 
W3D files, and then imported into a movie. Motions cannot be applied to model primitives 
created within Director. 

Adding the bonesPlayer modifier to a model by using the addModifier command allows access 
to the following bonesPl ayer modifier properties: 

playing (3D) indicates whether a model is executing a motion. 

pi ay 1 i st is a linear list of property lists containing the playback parameters of the motions that 
are queued for a model. 

currentTime (3D) indicates the local time, in milliseconds, of the currently playing or 
paused motion. 


bonesPlayer (modifier) 661 





play Rate (3D) is a number that is multiplied by the sea 7e parameter of the pi ay () orqueueO 
command to determine the playback speed of the motion. 

playlist. count (3D) returns the number of motions currently queued in the playlist. 

rootLock indicates whether the translational component of the motion is used or ignored. 

currentLoopState indicates whether the motion plays once or repeats continuously. 

bl endTi me indicates the length of the transition created by the modifier between motions when 
the modifier’s autoblend property is set to TRUE. 

autoblend indicates whether the modifier creates a linear transition to the currently playing 
motion from the motion that preceded it. 

blendFactor indicates the degree of blending between motions when the modifier’s autoBlend 
property is set to FALSE. 

bone[boneId] .transform indicates the transform of the bone relative to the parent bone. You 
can find the boneld value by testing the getBonelD property of the model resource. When you 
set the transform of a bone, it is no longer controlled by the current motion, and cannot be 
returned to the control of the motion. Manual control ends when the current motion ends. 

bone[boneId]. getWorl dT ransform returns the world-relative transform of the bone. 

lockTranslation indicates whether the model can be displaced from the specified planes. 

posi ti onReset indicates whether the model returns to its starting position after the end of a 
motion or each iteration of a loop. 

rotati onReset indicates the rotational element of a transition from one motion to the next, or 
the looping of a single motion. 

Note: For more detailed information about these properties, see the individual property entries. 

The bonesPlayer modifier uses the following commands: 
pa use () (3D ) halts the motion currently being executed by the model, 
pi ay () (3D) initiates or unpauses the execution of a motion, 
pi ayNext() (3D) initiates playback of the next motion in the playlist, 
queue () ( 3D ) adds a motion to the end of the playlist. 

The bonesPlayer modifier generates the following events, which are used by handlers declared in 
the regi sterForEvent( ) and regi sterScri pt( ) commands. The call to the declared handler 
includes three arguments: the event type (either #animati on Started or #animati on Ended), the 
name of the motion, and the current time of the motion. For detailed information about 
notification events, see regi sterForEvent( ). 

#ani mati on St a rted is sent when a motion begins playing. If blending is used between motions, 
the event is sent when the transition begins. 

#ani mati onEnded is sent when a motion ends. If blending is used between motions, the event is 
sent when the transition ends.

broadcastProps 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. broadcastProps 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. broadcastProps; 

Description 

Cast member property; controls whether changes made to a Flash or Vector shape cast member 
are immediately broadcast to all of its sprites currently on the Stage (TRUE) or not (FALSE). 

When this property is set to FALSE, changes made to the cast member are used only as defaults for

The default value for this property is TRUE, and it can be both tested and set. 

Example 

This frame script assumes that a Flash movie cast member named Navigation Movie has been set 
up with its broadcastProps property set to FALSE. The script momentarily allows changes to a 
Flash movie cast member to be broadcast to its sprites currently on the Stage. It then sets the 
v i ewSca 1 e property of the Flash movie cast member, and that change is broadcast to its sprite. 
The script then prevents the Flash movie from broadcasting changes to its sprites.

Read/write. 

This property applies only to buttons created with the Button tool in the Tool palette. 

The buttonSty 1 e property can have these values: 

• 0 (list style: default)—Subsequent buttons are highlighted when the pointer passes over them. 
Releasing the mouse button activates the script associated with that button. 

• 1 (dialog style)—Only the first button clicked is highlighted. Subsequent buttons are not 
highlighted. Releasing the mouse button while the pointer is over a button other than the 
original button clicked does not activate the script associated with that button.

Description 

Flash and Shockwave Audio cast member property; indicates the number of bytes of the specified 
cast member that have been loaded into memory. The bytesStreamed property returns a value 
only when the Director movie is playing. It returns an integer value. 

This property can be tested but not set. 

Example 

This handler accepts a cast member reference as a parameter, and it then uses the stream 
command to load the cast member into memory. Every time it streams part of the cast member 
into memory, it uses the bytesStreamed property to report in the Message window how many 
bytes have been streamed.

sprite( whichSprite) . camera{ ( index ) ) .whichCameraProperty 

Description 

3D element; an object at a vector position from which the 3D world is viewed. 

Each sprite has a list of cameras. The view from each camera in the list is displayed on top of the 
view from camera with lower index positions. You can set the rect ( camera ) property of each 
camera to display multiple views within the sprite. 


672 Chapter 14: Properties 



Cameras are stored in the camera palette of the cast member. Use the newCamera and 
deleteCamera commands to create and delete cameras in a 3D cast member. 

The camera property of a sprite is the first camera in the list of cameras of the sprite. The camera 
referred to by spri te( whichSpri te) . camera is the same as 

spri te( whi chSpri te) . camera (1). Use the addCamera and deleteCamera commands to build 
the list of cameras in a 3D sprite. 

For a complete list of camera properties and commands, see the Using Director topics in the 
Director Help Panel. 

Example 

This statement sets the camera of sprite 1 to the camera named TreeCam of the cast member 
named Picnic.

castMemberList 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. castMemberLi st 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. castMemberLi st; 

Description 

Cursor cast member property; specifies a list of cast members that make up the frames of a cursor. 
For whichCursorCastMember, substitute a cast member name (within quotation marks) or a cast 
member number. You can also specify cast members from different casts. 

The first cast member in the list is the first frame of the cursor, the second cast member is the 
second frame, and so on. 

If you specify cast members that are invalid for use in a cursor, they will be ignored, and the 
remaining cast members will be used. 

This property can be tested and set. 


castMemberList 675 





Example 

This command sets a series of four cast members for the animated color cursor cast member 
named myCursor. 

-- Lingo syntax 

membert"myCursor").castmemberList = \ 

[member(l), member(2), memberd, 2), member(2, 2)] 

// JavaScript syntax 

member("myCursor").castmemberList = 

1 ist(memberd), memberd), memberd, 2), memberd, 2)); 

center 

Usage 

member( whichCastMember) .center 
the center of member whichCastMember 

Description 

Cast member property; interacts with the crop cast member property. 

• When the crop property is FALSE, the center property has no effect. 

• When crop is TRUE and center is TRUE, cropping occurs around the center of the digital 
video cast member. 

• When crop is TRUE and center is FALSE, the digital video’s right and bottom sides 
are cropped. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement causes the digital video cast member Interview to be displayed in the top left 
corner of the sprite. 

Dot syntax: 

membert"Interview").center = FALSE 
Verbose syntax: 

set the center of member "Interview" to FALSE

centerRegPoint 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. centerRegPoi nt 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. centerRegPoi nt; 

Description 

Flash, vector shape, and bitmap cast member property; automatically centers the registration 
point of the cast member when you resize the sprite (TRUE , default); or repositions the 
registration point at its current point value when you resize the sprite, set the defaul tRect 
property, or set the regPoi nt property (FALSE). 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This script checks to see if a Flash movies centerRegPoi nt property is set to TRUE. Ifit is, the 
script uses the regPoi nt property to reposition the sprite’s registration point to its upper left 
corner. By checking the centerRegPoi nt property, the script ensures that it does not reposition a 
registration point that had been previously set using the regPoi nt property. 

-- Lingo syntax 
property spriteNum 

on beginSprite me 

if sprite(spriteNum).member.centerRegPoi nt = TRUE then 
sprite(spriteNum).member.regPoint = point(O.O) 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function beginSprite!) { 

var ctrRg = sprite(this.spriteNum).member.centerRegPoint; 
if (ctrRg = 1) { 

sprite(this.spriteNum).member.regPoi nt = point (0,0) ;

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.centerStage; 

Description 

Movie property; determines whether the Stage is centered on the monitor when the movie is 
loaded (TRUE , default) or not centered (FALSE). Read/write. 


centerStage 677 



Place the statement that includes this property in the movie that precedes the movie you want it 
to affect. 

This property is useful for checking the Stage location before a movie plays from a projector. 

Note: Be aware that behavior while playing back in a projector differs between Windows and 
Macintosh systems. Settings selected during creation of the projector may override this property. 

Example 

This statement sends the movie to a specific frame if the Stage is not centered: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_movie.centerStage = FALSE) then 
_movie.go("Off Center") 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 

if (_movie.centerStage == false) { 

_movie.go("Off Center"); 

I 


This statement changes the centerStage property to the opposite ofits current value: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.centerStage = not(_movie.centerStage) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.centerStage = !(_movie.centerStage)

changeArea 

Usage 

member (whi chCastMember ).changeArea 
the changeArea of member whichCastMember 

Description 

Transition cast member property; determines whether a transition applies only to the changing 
area on the Stage (TRUE) or to the entire Stage (FALSE). Its effect is similar to selecting the 
Changing Area Only option in the Frame Properties Transition dialog box. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement makes the transition cast member Wave apply only to the changing area on 
the Stage.

Description 

Text cast member property; enables specifying any additional spacing applied to each letter in the 
chunkExpressi on portion of the text cast member. 


680 Chapter 14: Properties 



A value less than 0 indicates less spacing between letters. A value greater than 0 indicates more 
spacing between letters. 

The default value is 0, which results in default spacing between letters. 

Example 

The following handler increases the current character spacing of the third through fifth words 
within the text cast member myCaption by a value of 2: 

--Lingo syntax 
on myCharSpacer 

mySpaceValue = member!"myCaption").word[3..5].charSpaci ng 
member("myCaption").word[3..5].charSpacing = (mySpaceValue + 2) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function myCharSpacer() { 
var i =3; 
while (i < 6) {

child (3D) 

Usage 

memb eriwhi chCastmember ).model ( whichParentNode ) ,\ 
child! whichChi1dNodeName) 

memberiwhichCastmember ).model ( whichParentNode ).chi 1 d[index] 

Description 

3D model, group, light, and camera property; returns the child node named 

wh i chChi 1 dNodeName or at the specified index in the parent node’s list of children. A node is a 

model, group, camera, or light. 

The transform of a node is parent-relative. If you change the position of the parent, its children 
move with it, and their positions relative to the parent are maintained. Changes to the rotation 
and scale properties of the parent are similarly reflected in its children. 

Use the addChi 1 d method of the parent node or set the parent property of the child node to add 
to the parents list of children. A child can have only one parent, but a parent can have any 
number of children. A child can also have children of its own. 

Example 

This statement shows that the second child of the model named Car is the model named Tire. 

put member!"3D").model("Car").chi 1d[2] 

- - model("Tire")

chunkSize 


Usage 

member( whichCastMember) . chunkSi ze 
the chunkSize of member whichCastMember 

Description 

Transition cast member property; determines the transition’s chunk size in pixels from 1 to 128 
and is equivalent to setting the smoothness slider in the Frame Properties: Transition dialog box. 
The smaller the chunk size, the smoother the transition appears. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement sets the chunk size of the transition cast member Fog to 4 pixels. 

Dot syntax: 

member("Fog").chunkSize = 4 
Verbose syntax: 

set the chunkSize of member "Fog" to 4 

clearAtRender 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .camera! whichCamera) .colorBuffer.\ 
clearAtRender 

sprite! whichSprite) .camera 1( index )).colorBuffer.cl earAtRender 

Description 

3D property; indicates whether the color buffer is cleared after each frame. Setting the value to 
FALSE, which means the buffer is not cleared, gives an effect similar to trails ink effect. The 
default value for this property is TRUE. 

Example 

This statement prevents Director from erasing past images of the view from the camera. Models 
in motion will appear to smear across the stage. 

sprite!1).camera.colorBuffer.clearAtRender = 0

Description 

3D property; specifies the color used to clear out the color buffer if 

col orBuffer . cl earAtRender is set to TRUE. The default setting for this property is 

rgb(0, 0, 0). 

Example 

This statement sets the clearValue property of the camera to rgb(255, 0, 0). Spaces in the 3d 
world which are not occupied by models will appear red. 

sprite(1).camera.colorBuffer.clearValue= rgb(255, 0, 0)

clearAtRender 

clickLoc 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_mouse.clickLoc 

// JavaScript syntax 
_mouse.clickLoc; 

Description 

Mouse property; identifies as a point the last place on the screen where the mouse was clicked. 
Read-only. 

Example 

The following on mouseDown handler displays the last mouse click location: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown 

put(_mouse.clickLoc) 
end mouseDown 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDown!) { 
put(_mouse.clickLoc); 

1 


If the click were 50 pixels from the left end of the Stage and 100 pixels from the top of the Stage, 
the Message window would display the following: 

point(50, 100)

clickMode 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef .cl i ckMode 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. cl i ckMode; 

Description 

Flash cast member and sprite property; controls when the Flash movie sprite detects mouse click 
events (mouseUp and mouseDown) and when it detects rollovers (mouseEnter, mouseWi thi n, and 
mouseLeave). The clickMode property can have these values: 

• #boundi ngBox—Detects mouse click events anywhere within the sprite’s bounding rectangle 
and detects rollovers at the sprite’s boundaries. 

• #opaque (default)—Detects mouse click events only when the pointer is over an opaque 
portion of the sprite and detects rollovers at the boundaries of the opaque portions of the sprite 
if the sprite’s ink effect is set to Background Transparent. If the sprite’s ink effect is not set to 
Background Transparent, this setting has the same effect as (/boundi ngBox. 

• (/object—Detects mouse click events when the mouse pointer is over any filled 
(nonbackground) area of the sprite and detects rollovers at the boundaries of any filled area. 
This setting works regardless of the sprite’s ink effect. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This script checks to see if the sprite, which is specified with an ink effect of Background 
Transparent, is currently set to be rendered direct to Stage. If the sprite is not rendered direct to 
Stage, the sprite’s cl i ckMode is set to (/opaque. Otherwise (because ink effects are ignored for 
Flash movie sprites that are rendered direct to Stage), the sprite’s cl i ckMode is set to 
(/boundi ngBox. 

-- Lingo syntax 
property spriteNum 

on beginSprite me 

if sprite(spriteNum).directToStage = FALSE then 
spri te( spri teNum). cl i ckMode = (/opaque

spri te( spri teNum). cl i ckMode = (/boundi ngBox 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function beginSprite(me){ 

var dts = sprite(this.spriteNum).directToStage; 
if (dts =0) { 

sprite(this.spriteNum).cl ickMode = symbol("opaque"); 

1 else 1 

sprite(this.spriteNum).clickMode = symbol("boundingBox"); 

1 


clickMode 685 



clickOn 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_mouse.clickOn 

// JavaScript syntax 
_mouse.clickOn; 

Description 

Mouse property; returns the last active sprite clicked by the user. Read-only. 

An active sprite is a sprite that has a sprite or cast member script associated with it. 

When the user clicks the Stage, cl i ckOn returns 0. To detect whether the user clicks a sprite 
with no script, you must assign a mouse event script to it so that it can be detected by cl i ckOn. 
For example: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseUp me 

end 

Buttons, check boxes, and radio buttons are detected by cl i ckOn even if there is no script 
attached to them. 

The cl i ckOn property can be checked within a loop. However, neither cl i ckOn nor cl i ckLoc 
change value when the handler is running. The value that you obtain is the value from before the 
handler started. 

Example 

This statement checks whether sprite 7 was the last active sprite clicked: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_mouse.clickOn = 7) then 

_player.alert("Sorry, try again.") 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_mouse.clickOn = 7) { 

_player.alert("Sorry, try again."); 

1 


This statement sets the foreCol or property of the last active sprite that was clicked to a 
random color: 

-- Lingo syntax 


sprite(_mouse.cl ickOn) 

.foreColor = 

(random!255) 

- 1 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(_mouse.cl ickOn) 

.foreColor = 

(random!255)

Description 

Vector shape cast member property; indicates whether the end points of a path are closed or open. 
Vector shapes must be closed in order to contain a fill. 

The value can be as follows: 

• TRUE —the end points are closed. 

• FALSE —the end points are open. 

closedCaptions 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
dvdObjRef. cl osedCapti ons 

// JavaScript syntax 
dvdObjRef. cl osedCapti ons ; 

Description 

DVD property. Determines whether closed captioning is enabled (TRUE), or if it is not or could 
not be enabled (FALSE). Currently unsupported on the Macintosh. Read/write. 

Example 

These statements try to set closedCaptions to TRUE, and display an alert if they cannot 
be enabled: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member(3).closedCaptions = TRUE 
if (member(3).closedCaptions = FALSE) then 

_player.alert("Closed captions cannot be enabled.") 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax

collision (modifier) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model (whichModel) ,\ 
col 1 i si on. co11isionModifierProperty 

Description 

3D modifier; manages the detection and resolution of collisions. Adding the col 1 i si on modifier 
to a model by using the addModi fi er command allows access to the following col 1 i si on 
modifier properties: 

enabled (collision) indicates whether collisions with the model are detected, 
resolve indicates whether collisions with the model are resolved, 
immovable indicates whether a model can be moved from frame to frame, 
mode (collision) indicates the geometry used for collision detection. 

Note: For more detailed information about these properties, see the individual property entries. 

The collision modifier generates the following events. For more information about using collision 
events, see the regi sterForEvent( ) entry. 

A #co I I i deAny event is generated when a collision occurs between models to which the 
col 1 i si on modifier has been attached. 

A #co I I i deWi th event is generated when a collision occurs with a specific model to which the 
col 1 i si on modifier has been attached. 

The col 1 i si onData object is sent as an argument with the #col 1 i deAny and #col 1 i deWi th 
events. See the colli si onData entry for details of its properties.

collisionData 

Usage 

on myHandlerName me, collisionData 

Description 

3D data object; sent as an argument with the #col 1 i deWi th and #col 1 i deAny events to the 
handler specified in the regi sterForEvent, regi sterScri pt, and setCol 1 i si onCal 1 back 
commands. The col 1 i si onData object has these properties: 

model A is one of the models involved in the collision. 

model B is the other model involved in the collision. 

poi ntOfContact is the world position of the collision. 

col 1 i si onNormal is the direction of the collision. 


688 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 


This example has three parts. The first part is the first line of code, which registers the 
#putDetai 1 s handler for the #col 1 i deAny event. The second part is the #putDetai 1 s handler. 
When two models in the cast member MyScene collide, the #putDeta i 1 s handler is called and 
the collisionData argument is sent to it. This handler displays the four properties of the 
colli si onData object in the message window. The third part of the example shows the results 
from the message window. The first two lines show that the model named GreenBall was model A 
and the model named YellowBall was model B in the collision. The third line shows the point of 
contact of the two models. The last line shows the direction of the collision. 

member("MyScene").registerForEvent(#col1ideAny, #putDetai1s, 0) 

on putDetails me, collisionData 
put col 1isionData.modelA 
put col 1isionData.modelB 
put colli sionData.pointOfContact

collisionData properties: modelA, modelB, pointOfContact, collisionNormal 
collisionData methods: resol veA, resol veB, collision (modifier) 

collisionNormal 

Usage 

col 1isionData.col 1isionNormal 

Description 

3D collisionData property; a vector indicating the direction of the collision. 

The col 1 i si onData object is sent as an argument with the #col 1 i deWi th and #col 1 i deAny 
events to the handler specified in the regi sterForEvent, regi sterScri pt, and 
setCol 1 i si onCal 1 back commands. 

The #col 1 i deWi th and #col 1 i deAny events are sent when a collision occurs between models to 
which collision modifiers have been added. The resol ve property of the models’ modifiers must 
be set to TRUE. 

This property can be tested but not set. 


collisionNorma! 689 



Example 

This example has two parts. The first part is the first line of code, which registers the #expl ode 
handler for the #col 1 i deAny event. The second part is the #expl ode handler. When two models 
in the cast member named MyScene collide, the #expl ode handler is called and the 
col 1 i si onData argument is sent to it. The first ten lines of the #expl ode handler create the 
model resource SparkSource and set its properties. This model resource is a single burst of 
particles. The tenth line sets the direction of the burst to col 1 i s i onNormal, which is the 
direction of the collision. The eleventh line of the handler creates a model called SparksModel 
using the model resource SparkSource. The last line of the handler sets the position of 
SparksModel to the position where the collision occurred. The overall effect is a collision that 
causes a burst of sparks to fly in the direction of the collision from the point of contact. 

member("MyScene").register ForEvent(#col1ideAny, #explode, 0) 
on explode me, collisionData 

nmr = memberi"MyScene").newModelResource!"SparkSource", #particle) 

nmr.emitter.mode = #burst

color() 

Usage 

colo rUlrgb, redValue, greenValue, blueValue) 
col orpa 1etteIndex, pa 1ettelndexNumber) 
rgb( rgbHexString) 

rgb( redValue, greenValue, blueValue ) 
paletteIndex(pa 1ettelndexNumber) 

Description 

Function and data type; determines an object’s color as either RGB or 8-bit palette index values. 
These are the same values as those used in the color member and color sprite properties, the 
bgCol or member and bgCol or sprite properties, and the bgCol or Stage property. 

The col or function allows for either 24-bit or 8-bit color values to be manipulated as well as 
applied to cast members, sprites, and the Stage. 

For RGB values, each color component has a range from 0 to 255, and all other values are 
truncated. For pal ettelndex types, an integer from 0 to 255 is used to indicate the index 
number in the current palette, and all other values are truncated. 


690 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 


This statement performs a math operation: 

palColorObj = palettelndex(20) 
put palColorObj 
-- palettelndex(20) 
put palColorObj / 2 
-- palettelndexi10) 

This statement converts one color type to another type: 

newColorObj = color(#rgb, 155, 0, 75) 
put newColorObj 
-- rgb(155, 0, 75) 

newColorObj.colorType = #palettelndex 
put newColorObj 
-- palettelndexi106) 

This statement obtains the hexadecimal representation of a color regardless of its type: 

someColorObj = color(#palettelndex, 32) 
put someColorObj.hexString() 

-- "#FF0099" 

This statement determines individual RGB components and the pal ettelndex value of a color 
regardless of its type: 

newColorObj = color(#rgb, 155, 0, 75) 
put newColorObj.green 
-- 0

This Lingo displays the color of sprite 6 in the Message window, and then sets the color of sprite 
6 to a new RGB value: 

put sprite(6).col or 

-- rgb( 255, 204, 102 ) 

sprite(6).color = rgb( 122, 98, 210) 

Note: Setting the pal ettelndex value of an RGB color type changes col orType to pal ettelndex. 
Setting the RGB color type of a pal ettelndex color sets its col orType value to RGB.

colorDepth 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_system.col orDepth 

// JavaScript syntax 
_system.col orDepth; 

Description 

System property; determines the color depth of the computer’s monitor. Read/write. 

• In Windows, using this property lets you check and set the monitor’s color depth. Some video 
card and driver combinations may not enable you to set the col orDepth property. Always 
verify that the color depth has actually changed after you attempt to set it. 

• On the Macintosh, this property lets you check the color depth of different monitors and 
change it when appropriate. 

Possible values are the following: 

1 Black and white 

2 4 colors 

4 16 colors 

8 256 colors 

16 32,768 or 65,536 colors 

32 16,777,216 colors 


If you try to set a monitor’s color depth to a value that monitor does not support, the monitor’s 
color depth doesn’t change. 

On computers with more than one monitor, the col orDepth property refers to the monitor 
displaying the Stage. If the Stage spans more than one monitor, the col orDepth property 
indicates the greatest depth of those monitors; col orDepth tries to set all those monitors to the 
specified depth. 


colorDepth 693 





Example 


This statement tells Director to open the movie Full color only if the monitor color depth is set to 
256 colors: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_system.colorDepth = 8) then 
windowC'Full col or"). open() 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_system.colorDepth == 8) { 
windowC'Full col or"). open() 

1 


The following handler tries to change the color depth, and if it can’t, it displays an alert: 

-- Lingo syntax 

on tryToSetColorDepthidesiredDepth) 

_system.colorDepth = desiredDepth 
if (_system.colorDepth = desiredDepth) then 
return true 
el se 

_player.alert("PI ease change your system to" && desiredDepth && "color \ 
depth and reboot.") 

return false 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function tryToSetColorDepth(desiredDepth) { 

_system.colorDepth = desiredDepth; 
if (_system.colorDepth == desiredDepth) { 
return true;

694 Chapter 14: Properties 



Description 


3D property; allows you to get or set every color used in a mesh. This command is accessible only 
for model resources of the type #mesh. Any single color can be shared by several vertices (faces) of 
the mesh. Alternately, you can specify texture coordinates for the faces of the mesh and apply a 
shader to models that use this model resource. 

This command must be set to a list of the same number of Lingo color values specified in the 
newMesh call. 

Example 

This statement shows that the third color in the col or Li st of the model resource Mesh2 is 
rgb(255, 0, 0). 

put member!"shapes").model Resource!"mesh2").colorlist[3] 

-- rgb(255,0,0)

colorRange 

Usage 

member! uhichCastmember) .model Resource! whichModelResource).\ 
colorRange.start 

member! uhichCastmember) .model Resource! wh i chModelResource). \ 
colorRange.end 

Description 

3D #pa rti cl e model resource properties; indicate the beginning color and ending color of the 
particles of a particle system. 

The start property is the color of the particles when they are created. The end property is the 
color of particles at the end of their lives. The color of each particle gradually changes from the 
value of start to the value of end over the course of its life. 

The st a rt and end properties have a default value of rgb! 255 , 255, 255). 

Example 

This statement sets the col orRange properties of the model resource named ThermoSystem. The 
first line sets the start value to rgb! 255 , 0 , 0 ), and the second line sets the end value to 
rgb(0, 0, 255). The effect of this statement is that the particles of ThermoSystem are red when 
they first appear, and gradually change to blue during their lifetimes. 

member(8,2).model Resource!"ThermoSystem").color Range.start = \ 
rgb(255,0,0) 

member(8,2).model Resource!"ThermoSystem").colorRange.end = \ 
rgb(0,0,255)

colors 


Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model Resource( whichModelResource). \ 
facet facelndex~\ .colors 

Description 

3D face property; a linear list of three integers indicating which index positions of the model 
resource’s color list to use for the three vertices of the face. The color list is a linear list of rgb 
values. 

The col ors property is used only with model resources whose type is #mesh. 

You must use the model resource’s bui 1 d() command after setting this property; otherwise, the 
changes will not take effect. 

Example 

This example creates a model resource whose type is #mesh, specifies its properties, and then 
creates a new model with it. 

Line 1 uses the newMesh() command to create a #mesh model resource named Triangle, which 
has one face, three vertices, and a maximum of three colors. The number of normals and the 
number of texture coordinates are not set. 

Line 2 sets the vertexList property to a list of three vectors. 

Line 3 assigns the vectors of the vertexLi st property to the vertices of the first face of Triangle. 
Line 4 sets the color list to three rgb values. 

Line 5 assigns colors to the first face of Triangle. The third color in the color list is applied to the 
first vertex of Triangle, the second color to the second vertex, and the first color to the third 
vertex. The colors will spread across the first face of Triangle in gradients. 

Line 6 creates the normals of Triangle with the generateNormal s () command. 

Line 7 uses the b u i 1 d () command to construct the mesh. 

Line 8 creates a new model named TriModel that uses the new mesh. 

nm = member("Shapes").newMesh!"Tri angl e",1,3,0,3,0) 

nm.vertexList = [vector(0,0,0), vector(20,0,0), vector(20, 20, 0)] 

nm.face[l].vertices = [1,2,3] 

nm.colorList = [rgb(255,255,0), rgb(0, 255, 0), rgb(0,0,255)] 
nm.face[l].colors = [3,2,1] 
nm.generateNormals(#smooth) 
nm.bui1d() 

nm = member!"Shapes").newModel("TriModel", nm)

colorSteps 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model (whichModel ).toon.colorSteps 
member! whichCastmember) .model (whichModel ) .shader.colorSteps 
member! whichCastmember) .shader! whichShader) .colorSteps 

Description 

3D toon modifier and pa i nter shader property; the maximum number of colors available for use 
by the toon modifier or pa i nter shader. The value of this property can be 2, 4, 8, or 16. If you 
set the value of col orSteps to any other number, it will be rounded to one of these. 

The default value is 2. 

Example 

This statement limits the number of colors available for use by the toon modifier for the model 
named Teapot to 8. The teapot will be rendered with a maximum of eight colors. 

member("shapes").model("Teapot").toon.colorSteps = 8

commandDown 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_key.commandDown 

// JavaScript syntax 
_key.commandDown; 

Description 

Key property; determines whether the Control key (Windows) or the Command key (Macintosh) 
is being pressed. Read-only. 

This property returns TRUE if the Control or Command key is being pressed; otherwise, it 
returns FALSE. 

You can use commandDown together with the key property to determine whether the Control or 
Command key is being pressed in combination with another key. This lets you create handlers 
that are executed when the user presses specified Control or Command key combinations. 

Control or Command key equivalents for the Director authoring menus take precedence while 
the movie is playing, unless you have installed custom Lingo or JavaScript syntax menus or are 
playing a projector version of the movie. 


commandDown 697 



Example 


These statements pause a projector when the playhead enters a frame and the user is pressing 
Control+A (Windows) or Command+A (Macintosh). 

-- Lingo syntax 
on enterFrame 

if (_key.commandDown and _key.key = "a") then

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. comments; 

Description 

Member property; provides a place to store any comments you want to maintain about the given 
cast member or any other strings you want to associate with the member. Read/write. 

This property can also be set in the Property inspector’s Member tab. 

Example 

This statement sets the comments of the member Backdrop to the string “Still need to license 
this artwork”: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"Backdrop").comments = "Still need to license this artwork" 

// JavaScript syntax 

member!"Backdrop").comments = "Still need to license this artwork":

698 Chapter 14: Properties 



compressed 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .texture( whichTexture ).compressed 

Description 

3D texture property; indicates whether the source cast member of the texture is compressed 
(TRUE) or not (FALSE). The value of the compressed property changes automatically from TRUE 
to FALSE when the texture is needed for rendering. It can be set to FALSE to decompress the 
texture at an earlier time. It can be set to TRUE to release the decompressed representation from 
memory. Cast members used for textures will not be compressed if this value is TRUE (apart from 
the standard compression used for bitmap cast members when a Director movie is saved). The 
default value for this property is TRUE. 

Example 

This statement sets the compressed property of the texture Plutomap to TRUE. 
member("scene").texture!"PIutomap").compressed = TRUE 

See also 

texture 

constraint 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef. constrai nt 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. constrai nt; 

Description 

Sprite property; determines whether the registration point of a sprite is constrained to the 
bounding rectangle of another sprite (1 or TRUE) or not (0 or FALSE, default). Read/write. 

The constraint property is useful for constraining a moveable sprite to the bounding rectangle 
of another sprite to simulate a track for a slider control or to restrict where on the screen a user 
can drag an object in a game. 

The constraint property affects moveable sprites and the 1 o c H and 1 o c V properties. The 
constraint point of a moveable sprite cannot be moved outside the bounding rectangle of the 
constraining sprite. (The constraint point for a bitmap sprite is the registration point. The 
constraint point for a shape sprite is its top left corner.) When a sprite has a constraint set, the 
constraint limits override any 1 ocH and 1 ocV property settings. 


constraint 699 



Example 

This statement removes a constraint sprite property: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(5).constraint = 0 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(5).constraint = 0; 

This statement constrains sprite (i + 1) to the boundary of sprite 14: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(i + 1).constraint = 14 

// JavaScript syntax 
spriteti + 1).constraint = 14; 

This statement checks whether sprite 3 is constrained and activates the handler showConstraint 
if it is: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (sprite(3).constraint <> 0) then 
showConstraint 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (sprite(3).constraint != 0) { 
showConstraint();

controlDown 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_key.control Down 

// JavaScript syntax 
_key.control Down; 

Description 

Key property; determines whether the Control key is being pressed. Read-only. 

This property returns TRUE if the Control key is being pressed; otherwise, it returns FALSE. 

You can use control Down together with the key property to determine whether the Control key 
is being pressed in combination with another key. This lets you create handlers that are executed 
when the user presses specified Control key combinations. 

Control or key equivalents for the Director authoring menus take precedence while the movie is 
playing, unless you have installed custom Lingo or JavaScript syntax menus or are playing a 
projector version of the movie. 


700 Chapter 14: Properties

controller. 

The control 1 er member property applies to a QuickTime digital video only. 

• Setting the controller member property for a Video for Windows digital video performs no 
operation and generates no error message. 

• Checking the controller member property for a Video for Windows digital video always 
returns FALSE. 

The digital video must be in direct-to-stage playback mode to display the controller.

cpuHogTicks 

Usage 

the cpuHogTicks 

Description 

System property; determines how often Director releases control of the CPU to let the computer 
process background events, such as events in other applications, network events, clock updates, 
and other keyboard events. 

The default value is 20 ticks. To give more time to Director before releasing the CPU to 
background events or to control how the computer responds to network operations, set 
cpuHogTicks to a higher value. 

To create faster auto-repeating key performance but slower animation, set cpuHogTi cks to a 
lower value. In a movie, when a user holds down a key to generate a rapid sequence of auto¬ 
repeating key presses, Director typically checks for auto-repeating key presses less frequently than 
the rate set in the computer’s control panel. 

The cpuHogTicks property works only on the Macintosh. 

Example 

This statement tells Director to release control of the CPU every 6 ticks, or every 0.10 of a 
second: 

the cpuHogTicks = 6

creaseAngle 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .model (.whichModel ) .inker. creaseAngl e 
member! whichCastmember) .model( whichModel) .toon.creaseAngl e 

Description 

3D inker and toon modifier property; indicates the sensitivity of the line drawing function of 
the modifier to the presence of creases in the model’s geometry. Higher settings result in more 
lines (detail) drawn at creases. 


creaseAngle 705 



The creases property of the modifier must be set to TRUE for the creaseAngl e property to 
have an effect. 

CreaseAngl e has a range of-1.0 to +1.0. The default setting is 0.01. 

Example 

This statement sets the creaseAngl e property of the inker modifier applied to the model named 
Teapot to 0.10. A line will be drawn at all creases in the model that exceed this threshold. This 
setting will only take effect if the inker modifier’s creases property is set to T R U E. 

member("shapes").model("Teapot").inker.creaseAngle = 0.10

currentLoopState 

Usage 

member ( whi chCastmember) .model (.whi chModel ). keyframe PI ayer . \ 
currentLoopState 

member( whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel) .bonesPlayer.X 
currentLoopState 

Description 

3D keyf ramePl ayer and bonesPl ayer modifier property; indicates whether the motion being 
executed by the model repeats continuously (TRUE) or plays to the end and is replaced by the next 
motion in the modifiers playlist (FALSE). 

The default setting for this property is the value of the looped parameter of the pi ay () command 
that initiated playback of the motion, or the value of the queue! ) command that added the 
motion to the modifier’s playlist. Changing the currentLoopState property also changes the 
value of the #1 ooped property of the motions entry in the modifier’s playlist. 

Example 

This statement causes the motion that is being executed by the model named Monster to repeat 
continuously 

member!"NewAlien").model("Monster").keyframePlayer.\ 
currentLoopState = TRUE

currentSpriteNum 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_p layer.currentSpriteNum 

// JavaScript syntax 
_p layer.currentSpriteNum; 

Description 

Player property; indicates the channel number of the sprite whose script is currently running. 
Read-only. 

This property is valid in behaviors and cast member scripts. When used in frame scripts or movie 
scripts, the currentSpri teNum property’s value is 0. 

The currentSpri teNum property is similar to the Sprite object’s spri teNum property. 

Note: This property was more useful during transitions from older movies to Director 6, when 
behaviors were introduced. It allowed some behavior-like functionality without having to completely 
rewrite script. It is not necessary when authoring with behaviors and is therefore less useful than in 
the past. 


currentSpriteNum 709 






Example 

The following handler in a cast member or movie script switches the cast member assigned to the 
sprite involved in the mouseDown event: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown 

spri te(_pi ayer.currentSpriteNum).member = member("DownPict") 

end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDownO { 

sprite(_player.currentSpriteNum).member = member("Down Pict");

currentTime (3D) 

Usage 

member! whi chCastmember) .model (.whi chModel ) . keyframe PI ayer. \ 
currentTime 

member! whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel) .bonesPlayer.X 
currentTime 

Description 

3D keyf ramePl ayer and bones PI ayer modifier property; indicates the local time of the motion 
being executed by the model. The currentTi me property is measured in milliseconds, but it only 
corresponds to real time when the motion is playing at its original speed. 

Playback of a motion by a model is the result of either a pi ay () or queue () command. The 
seal e parameter of the pi ay () or queue!) command is multiplied by the modifiers pi ay Rate 
property, and the resulting value is multiplied by the motion’s original speed to determine how 
fast the model will execute the motion and how fast the motions local time will run. So if the 
scale parameter has a value of 2 and the modifier’s pi ay Rate property has a value of 3, the 
model will execute the motion six times as fast as its original speed and local time will run six 
times as fast as real time. 

The currentTime property resets to the value of the cropStart parameter of the pi ay () or 
queue C) command at the beginning of each iteration of a looped motion. 

Example 

This statement shows the local time of the motion being executed by the model named Alien3. 

put member!"newalien").model( "A1 ien3").keyframePlayer.currentTime

currentTime (DVD) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
dvdObjRef. currentT i me 

// JavaScript syntax 
dvdObjRef. currentT i me; 

Description 

DVD property; returns the elapsed time, in milliseconds. Read/write. 

Example 

This statement returns the elapsed time: 

-- Lingo syntax 

trace (member(l).currentTime) -- 11500 
// JavaScript syntax 

trace (member(l).currentTime); // 11500 

This statement sets currentTime to a specific point in the current title: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member(l).currentTime = 22000 

// JavaScript syntax 
member(l).currentTime = 22000

currentTime (QuickTime, AVI) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri teObjRef. currentT i me 

// JavaScript syntax

Description 

Digital video sprite property; determines the current time of a digital video movie playing in the 
channel specified by wh i chSpr i te. The mov i eTi me value is measured in ticks. 

This property can be tested and set. 

To see an example of currentTime used in a completed movie, see the QT and Flash movie in 
the Learning/Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

This statement displays the current time of the QuickTime movie in channel 9 in the 
Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(9).currentTime) 


currentTime (QuickTime, AVI) 711 




// JavaScript syntax 
put(sprite(9).currentTime); 

This statement sets the current time of the QuickTime movie in channel 9 to the value in the 
variable Poster: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(9).currentTime = Poster 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(9).currentTime = Poster; 

See also 

duration (Member) 

currentTime (RealMedia) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef .currentT i me 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. currentTime; 

Description 

RealMedia sprite or cast member property; allows you to get or set the current time of the 
RealMedia stream, in milliseconds. If the RealMedia cast member is not playing, the value of this 
property is 0, which is the default setting. This is a playback property, and it is not saved. 

If the stream is playing when the currentTi me property is set or changed, a seek action takes 
place, the stream rebuffers, and then playback resumes at the new time. If the stream is paused 
(#paused medi aStatus value) when currentTime is set or changed, the stream redraws the 
frame at the new time, and it resumes playback if pa used At St art is set to FALSE. When the 
stream is paused or stopped in the RealMedia viewer, medi aStatus is #p a used. When the stream 
is stopped by the Lingo stop command, medi aStatus is #cl osed. This property has no effect if 
the stream’s medi aStatus value is #cl osed. When you set integer values, they are clipped to the 
range from 0 to the duration of the stream. 

Setting currentTime is equivalent to invoking the seek command: x. seek(n) is the same as 
x. currentTime = n. Changing currentTime or calling seek will require the stream to be 
rebuffered. 

Example 

The following examples show that the current time of the sprite 2 and the cast member Real is 
15,534 milliseconds (15.534 seconds) from the beginning of the stream. 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(2).currentTime) -- 15534 
put(member!"Real").currentTime) -- 15534 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(sprite(2).currentTime) // 15534 

put(member("Real").currentTime) // 15534 

The following examples cause playback to jump 20,000 milliseconds (20 seconds) into the stream 
of sprite 2 and the cast member Real. 


712 Chapter 14: Properties 




-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(2).currentTime = 20000

currentTime (Sprite) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri teObjRef. currentT i me 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. currentT i me; 

Description 

Sprite and sound channel property; returns the current playing time, in milliseconds, for a sound 
sprite, QuickTime digital video sprite, or any Xtra extension that supports cue points. For a 
sound channel, returns the current playing time of the sound member currently playing in the 
given sound channel. 

This property can be tested, but can only be set for traditional sound cast members (WAV, AIFF, 
SND). When this property is set, the range of allowable values is from zero to the durati on of 
the member. 

Shockwave Audio (SWA) sounds can appear as sprites in sprite channels, but they play sound in a 
sound channel. You should refer to SWA sound sprites by their sprite channel number rather than 
by a sound channel number. 

Example 

This statement displays the current time, in seconds, of the sound sprite in sprite channel 10. 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("time").text = string(sprite(10).currentTime/ 1000) 

// JavaScript syntax 

member( "time") .text = (spri te( 10). currentTime / 1000) .toStringO ; 

This statement causes the sound playing in sound channel 2 to skip to the point 2.7 seconds from 
the beginning of the sound cast member: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sound(2).currentTime = 2700 

// JavaScript syntax 
sound(2).currentTime = 2700;

cursor 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spriteObjRef. cursor 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. cursor; 

Description 

Sprite property; determines the cursor used when the pointer is over a sprite. Read/write. 

This property stays in effect until you turn it off by setting the cursor to 0. Use the cursor 
property to change the cursor when the mouse pointer is over specific regions of the screen and to 
indicate regions where certain actions are possible when the user clicks on them. 

When you set the cursor property in a given frame, Director keeps track of the sprite rectangle to 
determine whether to alter the cursor. This rectangle persists when the movie enters another 
frame unless you set the cursor property for that channel to 0. 

• Use the following syntax to specify the number of a cast member to use as a cursor and its 
optional mask. 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef.cursor = [ castMemberObjRef , maskCastMemberObjRef] 

II JavaScript syntax 

spriteObjRef .cursor = [ castMemberObjRef , maskCastMemberObjRef]; 

• Use the following syntax to specify default system cursors. 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef .cursor = castMemberObjRef 
II JavaScript syntax 

spriteObjRef .cursor = castMemberObjRef; 

The cursor property can be set to one of the following integer values:

Custom 


To use custom cursors, set the cursor property to a list containing the cast member to be used as 
a cursor or to the number that specifies a system cursor. In Windows, a cursor must be a cast 
member, not a resource; if a cursor is not available because it is a resource, Director displays the 
standard arrow cursor instead. For best results, don’t use custom cursors when creating cross¬ 
platform movies. 

Custom cursor cast members must be no larger than 16 by 16 pixels, and must be 1-bit in depth. 

If the sprite is a bitmap that has matte ink applied, the cursor changes only when the cursor is 
over the matte portion of the sprite. 

When the cursor is over the location of a sprite that has been removed, rollover still occurs. Avoid 
this problem by not performing rollovers at these locations or by relocating the sprite up above 
the menu bar before deleting it. 

On the Macintosh, you can use a numbered cursor resource in the current open movie file as the 
cursor by setting cursor to the number of the cursor resource. 

Example 

This statement changes the cursor that appears over sprite 20 to a watch (Macintosh) or hourglass 
(Windows) cursor. 

-- Lingo syntax 
sprite(20).cursor = 4 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(20).cursor = 4;

716 Chapter 14: Properties 






cursorSize 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. cursorSi ze 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef .cursorSi ze; 

Description 

Cursor cast member property; specifies the size of the animated color cursor cast member 

whi chCursorCastMember. 


Specify size: 

For cursors up to: 

16 

16 by 16 pixels 

32 

32 by 32 pixels 


Bitmap cast members smaller than the specified size are displayed at full size, and larger ones are 
scaled proportionally to the specified size. 

The default value is 32 for Windows and 16 for the Macintosh. If you set an invalid value, an 
error message appears when the movie runs (but not when you compile). 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This command resizes the animated color cursor stored in cast member 20 to 32 by 32 pixels. 

-- Lingo syntax 

member(20).cursorSize = 32 

// JavaScript syntax 
member(20).cursorSize = 32; 

curve 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberObjRef. curve [curve/. 7 st Index] 

II JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef.curvelcurveListlndex ]; 

Description 

This property contains the vertexLi st of an individual curve (shape) from a vector shape cast 
member. You can use the curve property along with the vertex property to get individual vertices 
of a specific curve in a vector shape. 

A vertexLi st is a list ofvertices, and each vertex is a property list containing up to three 
properties: a #vertex property with the location of the vertex, a #handlel property with the 
location of the first control point for that vertex, and a #handle2 property with the location of the 
second control point for that vertex. See vertexLi st. 


curve 717 



Example 

This statement displays a sample list of vertices of the third curve of vector shape member 
SimpleCurves: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(member("SimpieCurves").curve[3]) 

-- [[^vertex: point(113.0000, 40.0000), #handlel: point(32.0000, 10.0000), \ 
#handle2: point(-32.0000 , -10.0000)], [^vertex: point(164.0000, 56.0000)]] 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(member("SimpieCurves").curve[3]); 

// [[#vertex: point(113.0000, 40.0000), #handlel: point(32.0000, 10.0000), 
#handie2: point(-32.0000, -10.0000)], [#vertex: point(164.0000, 56.0000)]] 

This statement moves the first vertex of the first curve in a vector shape down and to the right by 
10 pixels: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member! 1).curved].vertex[l] = member(l) .curved] .vertex[l] + point(10, 10) 

// JavaScript syntax 

member( 1). curved]. vertex[l] = member(l) .curved] ,vertex[l] + point(10, 10); 

The following code moves a sprite to the location of the first vertex of the first curve in a vector 
shape. The vector shape’s ori gi nMode must be set to #topLeft for this to work. 

-- Lingo syntax 

vertexLoc = member(l) .curved] .vertex[l] 
spriteLoc = mapMemberToStage(sprite(3), vertexLoc) 
sprite(7).1oc = spriteLoc 

// JavaScript syntax 

var vertexLoc = memberd).curved] .vertexLl]; 

var spriteLoc = mapMemberToStage(sprite(3), vertexLoc): 

sprite(7).1oc = spriteLoc; 

debug 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model (whichModel ).debug 

Description 

3D model property; indicates whether the bounding sphere and local axes of the model 
are displayed. 

Example 

This statement sets the debug property of the model Dog to TRUE. 
member("ParkScene").model("Dog").debug = TRUE

718 Chapter 14: Properties 




debugPlaybackEnabled 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_player.debugPlaybackEnabled 

// JavaScript syntax 
_player.debugPlaybackEnabled; 

Description 

Player property; in Windows, opens a Message window for debugging purposes in Shockwave 
and projectors. On the Macintosh, a log file is generated to allow put statements to output data 
for debugging purposes. Read/write. 

In Windows, this property does not have any effect when used in the Director application. Once 
the Message window is closed, it cannot be reopened for a particular Shockwave Player or 
projector session. If more than one movie with Shockwave content uses this script in a single 
browser, only the first will open a Message window, and the Message window will be tied to the 
first movie alone. 

On the Macintosh, the generated log file is located in the Shockwave Player folder at HardDrive/ 
System Folder/Extensions/Macromedia/Shockwave. 

To open this Message window, set the debugPlaybackEnabled property to TRUE. To close the 
window, set the debugPl aybackEnabl ed property to FALSE. 

Example 

This statement opens the Message window in either Shockwave Player or a projector: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.debugPlaybackEnabl ed = TRUE 

// JavaScript syntax 

_player.debugPlaybackEnabled = true; 

See also 

Player, put() 

decayMode 

Usage 

member( uhichCastmember) .camera! whichCamera) .fog.decayMode 
sprite! whichSprite) .camera{( index )1.fog.decayMode 

Description 

3D property; indicates the manner in which fog density builds from minimum to maximum 
density when the camera’s fog . enabl ed property is set to TRUE. 

The following are the possible values for this property: 

• #1 i near: the fog density is linearly interpolated between fog .near and fog. fa r. 

• #exponenti al: fog . far is the saturation point; fog. near is ignored. 

• #exponenti al 2: fog . near is the saturation point; fog . far is ignored. 

The default setting for this property is #exponenti al. 


decayMode 719 



Example 

This statement sets the decayMode property of the fog of the camera Defaultview to #1 i near. If 
the fog’s enabled property is set to TRUE, the density of the fog will steadily increase between the 
distances set by the fog’s near and far properties. If the near property is set to 100 and the fa r 
property is set to 1000, the fog will begin 100 world units in front of the camera and gradually 
increase in density to a distance of 1000 world units in front of the camera. 

member("3d world").camera("Defaultview").fog.decayMode = #linear 

See also 

fog, near (fog), far (fog), enabled (fog) 

defaultRect 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef .defaul tRect 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. defaul tRect; 

Description 

Cast member property; controls the default size used for all new sprites created from a Flash 
movie or vector shape cast member. The defaultRect setting also applies to all existing sprites 
that have not been stretched on the Stage. You specify the property values as a Director rectangle; 
for example, rect(0,0,32,32). 

The defaultRect member property is affected by the cast member’s default Re ctMode member 
property. The defaul tRectMode property is always set to #F1 ash when a movie is inserted into a 
cast, which means the original defaul tRect setting is always the size of the movie as it was 
originally created in Flash. Setting defaul tRect after that implicitly changes the cast member’s 
defaul tRectMode property to #fi xed. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This handler accepts a cast reference and a rectangle as parameters. It then searches the specified 
cast for Flash cast members and sets their defaultRect property to the specified rectangle. 

-- Lingo syntax 

on setDefaultFIashRect(whichCast, whichRect) 

repeat with i = 1 to castLib(whichCast).member.count 
if memberti, whichCast).type = #flash then 
member(i, whichCast).defaultRect = whichRect 
end i f 
end repeat 
end 


720 Chapter 14: Properties 



// JavaScript syntax 

function setDefaultF1ashRect(whichCast, whichRect) { 
var i = 1; 

while( i < (cast Lib(whichCast).member.count) + 1) 
var tp = member(i, whichCast).type; 
if (tp = "flash") { 

member(i, whichCast).defaultRect = whichRect; 
i++;

defaultRectMode , flashRect 

defaultRectMode 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberObj Ref .defaul tRectMode 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef .defaul tRectMode; 

Description 

Cast member property; controls how the default size is set for all new sprites created from Flash 
movie or vector shape cast members. You specify the property value as a Director rectangle; for 
example, rect(0,0,32,32). 

The defaultRectMode property does not set the actual size of a Flash movie’s default rectangle; it 
only determines how the default rectangle is set. The defaul tRectMode member property can 
have these values: 

• #f 1 ash (default)—Sets the default rectangle using the size of the movie as it was originally 
created in Flash. 

• #fi xed —Sets the default rectangle using the fixed size specified by the defaul tRect 
member property. 

The defaul tRect member property is affected by the cast member’s defaultRectMode member 
property. The defaul tRectMode property is always set to #f 1 ash when a movie is inserted into a 
cast, which means the original defaul tRect setting is always the size of the movie as it was 
originally created in Flash. Setting defaul tRect after that implicitly changes the cast member’s 
defaul tRectMode property to #fi xed. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This handler accepts a cast reference and a rectangle as parameters. It then searches the specified 
cast for Flash cast members, sets their defaul tRectMode property to #fi xed, and then sets their 
defaul tRect property to rect(0,0,320,240).

density 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .shader( whichShader ).density 
member! whichCastmember ).model (whichModel) .shader.density 
member (whichCastmember ).model (whichModel ).shaderList{[ index ]}.\ 
density 

Description 

3D #engra ver and #newspri nt shader property; adjusts the number of lines or dots used to 
create the effects of these specialized shader types. Higher values result in more lines or dots. 

For #engraver shaders, this property adjusts the number of lines used to create the image. The 
range is 0 to 100 and the default value is 40. 

For #newspri nt shaders, this property adjusts the number of dots used to create the image. The 
value can be from 0 to 100 and the default value is 45. 

Example 

The following statement sets the density property of the shader named EngShader to 10. The 
lines used by this #engraver shader to create its stylized image will be coarse and far apart. 

member("scene").shader!"EngShader").density = 10 

The following statement sets the densi ty property of the shader gbShader to 100. The dots used 
by this #newspri nt shader to create its stylized image will be very fine and close together. 

member("scene").shader!"gbShader").density = 100

depth (3D) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model (whichModel ).sds.depth 

Description 

3D subdivision surfaces (sds) modifier property; specifies the maximum number of levels of 
resolution that the model can display when using the sds modifier. 

If the sds modifier’s error and tensi on settings are low, increasing the depth property will have 
a more pronounced effect on the model’s geometry 

The sds modifier cannot be used with the i nker or toon modifiers, and you should be careful 
when using the sds modifier with the 1 od modifier. 

Example 

This statement sets the depth property of the sds modifier for the model named Baby to 3. If the 
sds modifier’s error and tension settings are low, this will cause a very pronounced effect on 
Baby’s geometry 

member("Scene").model("Baby").sds.depth = 3

digitalVideoTimeScale 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.digitalVideoTimeScale 

// JavaScript syntax 

_player.digitalVideoTimeScal e; 

Description 

Player property; determines the time scale, in units per second, that the system uses to track 
digital video cast members. Read/write. 

The digitalVideoTimeScale property can be set to any value you choose. 

The value of this property determines the fraction of a second that is used to track the video, as in 
the following examples: 

• 100—The time scale is 1/100 of a second (and the movie is tracked in 100 units per second). 

• 500—The time scale is 1/500 of a second (and the movie is tracked in 500 units per second). 

• 0—Director uses the time scale of the movie that is currently playing. 

Set digitalVideoTimeScale to precisely access tracks by ensuring that the systems time unit for 
video is a multiple of the digital video’s time unit. Set the di gi tal Vi deoT i meScal e property to a 
higher value to enable finer control of video playback. 

Example 

This statement sets the time scale that the system uses to measure digital video to 600 units 
per second: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.digitalVideoTimeScale = 600

#quickTime or #vi deoForWindows. 

This property can be tested but not set. 


digitalVideoType 727 



Example 

The following statement tests whether the cast member Todays Events is a QuickTime or AVI 
(Audio-Video Interleaved) digital video and displays the result in the Message window: 

put member!"Today's Events").digitalVideoType 

See also 

quickTimeVersion() 

direction 

Usage 

member! uhichCastmember ).model Resource! whichModelResource). \ 
emitter.directi on 

Description 

3D emitter property; a vector that indicates the direction in which the particles of a particle 
system are emitted. A particle system is a model resource whose type is #pa rti cl e. 

The primary direction of particle emission is the vector set by the emitters di recti on property. 
However, the direction of emission of a given particle will deviate from that vector by a random 
angle between 0 and the value of the emitter’s angle (3D) property. 

Setting direction to vector(O.O.O) causes the particles to be emitted in all directions. 

The default value of this property is vector(l,0,0). 

Example 

In this example, ThermoSystem is a model resource whose type is #pa rt i cl e. This statement sets 
the direction property of ThermoSystem’s emitter tovectord, 0, 0), which causes the 
particles of ThermoSystem to be emitted into a conical region whose axis is the X axis of the 
3D world. 

member!"Fires").model Resource!"ThermoSystem").emitter.\ 
direction = vector!1,0,0)

emitter, angle (3D) 

directionalColor 

Usage 

member(whichCastmember ).di rectional Col or 

Description 

3D cast member property; indicates the RGB color of the default directional light of the 
cast member. 

The default value of this property is rgb(255, 255, 255). 


728 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 

This statement sets the di recti onal Col or property of the cast member named Room to rgb(0, 
255, 0). The default directional light of the cast member will be green. This property can also be 
set in the Property inspector. 

member("Room").directionaicol or = rgb(0, 255, 0) 

See also 

di rectionalPreset 

directionalPreset 

Usage 

memberiwhichCastmember ).di rectional Preset 

Description 

3D cast member property; indicates the direction from which the default directional light shines, 
relative to the camera of the sprite. 

Changing the value of this property results in changes to the posi ti on and rotati on properties 
of the light’s transform. 

Possible values ofdi rectional Preset include the following: 

• #topLeft 

• #topCenter 

• #topRight 

• #middleLeft 

• #middleCenter 

• #middleRight 

• #bottomLeft 

• #bottomCenter 

• #bottomRight 

• #None 

The default value of this property is #topCenter. 

Example 

This statement sets the directional Preset property of the cast member named Room to 
#mi ddl eCenter. This points the default light of Room so it will shine on the middle center the 
current view of the camera of the sprite. This property can also be set in the Property inspector. 

member("Room").directionalpreset = #middleCenter

directToStage 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. di rectToStage 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. di rectToStage; 

Description 

Cast member and sprite property; determines the layer where a digital video, animated GIF, 
vector shape, 3D, Windows Media, or Flash Asset cast member plays. 

If this property is TRUE (1), the cast member plays in front of all other layers on the Stage, and 
ink effects have no affect. 

If this property is FALSE (0), the cast member can appear in any layer of the Stage’s animation 
planes, and ink effects affect the appearance of the sprite. 

• Use the syntax member! whichCastMember) .di rectToStage for digital video or 
animated GIFs. 

• Use the syntax sprite! whichSpri tel. di rectToStage for Flash or vector shapes. 

• Use either syntax for 3D cast members or sprites. 

Using this property improves the playback performance of the cast member or sprite. 

No other cast member can appear in front of a di rectToStage sprite. Also, ink effects do not 
affect the appearance of a directToStage sprite. 

When a sprites di rectToStage property is TRUE, Director draws the sprite directly to the screen 
without first compositing it in the Director offscreen buffer. The result can be similar to the trails 
ink effect of the Stage. 

Explicitly refresh a trailed area by turning the di rectToStage property off and on, using a full¬ 
screen transition, or “wiping” another sprite across this area. (In Windows, if you don’t do this, 
you can branch to another similar screen, and the video may not completely disappear.) 

To see an example of di rectToStage used in a completed movie, see the QT and Flash movie in 
the Learning/Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

This statement makes the QuickTime movie The Residents always play in the top layer of 
the Stage: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("The Residents").directToStage = 1 
// JavaScript syntax 

member!"The Residents").directToStage = 1; 


730 Chapter 14: Properties 



disablelmagingT ransformation 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.disablelmagingTransformati on 

// JavaScript syntax 

_player.disablelmagingTransformati on; 

Description 

Player property; determines whether Director automatically takes Stage scrolling or zooming into 
account capturing the image of the Stage. Read/write. 

When TRU E, this property prevents Director from automatically taking Stage scrolling or zooming 
into account when the image property is used to get the image of the Stage. Zooming and 
scrolling of the Stage will affect the appearance of the image captured by using i mage. 

When FALSE, Director will always capture the image of the Stage as if the Stage window was 
zoomed at 100% and was not scrolled out from the center of the Stage window. FALSE is the 
default value. 

Example 

This statement sets di sabl elmagi ngTransformati on to TRUE: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.disablelmagingTransformation = TRUE 

// JavaScript syntax 

_player.digitalVideoTimeScale = true;

displayFace 

Usage 

member(whichTextCastmember ).dispi ayFace 

member( which3DCastmember ).model Resource! whichModelResource).\ 
display Face 

Description 

3D text property; a linear list indicating which face or faces of the 3D text to display. Possible 
values include #f ront, #tunnel, and #back. You can show any combination of faces, and the list 
can be in any order. 

The default value of this property is [#f ront, #back, #tunnel]. 

For text cast members, this is a member property. For extruded text in a 3D cast member, this is a 
model resource property. 

Example 

In this example, the cast member named Rugsign is a text cast member. This statement sets the 
di spl ay Face property of Rugsign to [#tunnel ]. When Rugsign is displayed in 3D mode, its 
front and back faces will not appear. 

member!"Rugsign").displayFace = [#tunnel] 


displayFace 731 



In this example, the model resource of the model named Slogan is extruded text. This statement 
sets the di spl ay Face property of Slogan's model resource to [#back, #tunnel ]. The front face 
of Slogan will not be drawn. 

member("scene").model("SIogan").resource.display Face = \ 

[#back, #tunnel]

extrude3D, displayMode 

displayMode 

Usage 

member(whichTextCastmember ).displ ayMode 

Description 

Text cast member property; specifies whether the text will be rendered as 2D text or 3D text. 

If this property is set to #Mode3D, the text is shown in 3D. You can set the 3D properties (such as 
di spl ayFace and bevel Depth) of the text, as well as the usual text properties (such as text and 
font). The sprite containing this cast member becomes a 3D sprite. 

If this property is set to #ModeNormal , the text is shown in 2D. 

The default value of this property is #ModeNormal. 

Example 

In this example, the cast member named Logo is a text cast member. This statement causes Logo 
to be displayed in 3D. 

member("Logo").displayMode = #mode3D

extrude3D 

displayRealLogo 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef .displ ayReal Logo 

// JavaScript syntax 

memberOrSpri teObjRef. di splay Real Logo; 

Description 

RealMedia sprite or cast member property; allows you to set or get whether the RealNetworks 
logo is displayed (TRUE) or not (FALSE). When set to TRUE, this property displays the 
RealNetworks logo in the RealMedia viewer at the beginning of the stream, when the video is 
stopped, or when the video is rewound. 

The default value of this property is TRUE (1). Integer values other than 1 or 0 are treated as TRUE. 


732 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 

The following examples show that the di spl ayReal Logo property for sprite 2 and the cast 
member Real is set to TRUE, which means that the RealNetworks logo is displayed when the 
movie starts to play and when it is stopped or rewound. 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(2).displayRealLogo) -- 1 
put(member("Real").displayRealLogo) -- 1 

// JavaScript syntax 

trace!sprite(2).display Real Logo); // 1 

put(member("Real").displayReal Logo); // 1 

The following examples set the di spl ayReal Logo property for sprite 2 and the cast member Real 
to FALSE, which means that the RealNetworks logo is not displayed. 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(2).displayReal Logo = FALSE 
member!"Real").displayRealLogo = FALSE 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(2).displayRealLogo = 0; 

member!"Real").displayRealLogo = 0; 

displayTemplate

emitter.distribution 

Description 

3D emitter property; indicates how the particles of a particle system are distributed across the 
emitter’s region at their creation. The possible values of this property are #gaussi an or #1 i nea r. 
The default value is #1 inear. 

Example 

In this example, ThermoSystem is a model resource whose type is #parti cl e. This statement sets 
the distribution property ofThermoSystem’s emitter to #1 inear, which causes the particles of 
ThermoSystem to be evenly distributed across their origin region at their birth. 

member!"Fires").model Resource!"ThermoSystem").emitter.\ 
distribution = #1 inear

dither 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. di ther 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef.di ther; 

Description 

Bitmap cast member property; dithers the cast member when it is displayed at a color depth of 8 
bits or less (256 colors) if the display must show a color gradation not in the cast member (TRUE), 
or tells Director to choose the nearest color out of those available in the current palette (FALSE). 

For both performance and quality reasons, you should set dither to TRUE only when higher 
display quality is necessary. Dithering is slower than remapping, and artifacts may be more 
apparent when animating over a dithered image. 

If the color depth is greater than 8 bits, this property has no effect.

dockingEnabled 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.displayTempi ate.dockingEnabled 
windowObjRef. dockingEnabled 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.displayTempi ate.dockingEnabled; 

windowObjRef. dockingEnabled; 

Description 

Movie and Window property; specifies whether a movie in a window (MIAW) will be a dockable 
window when opened during authoring. Read/write. 

This property cannot be accessed directly from a Movie object; you access this property from the 
Movie object’s di spl ayTempl ate property. 

The default value of this property is FALSE, which specifies that a MIAW will not be dockable 
when opened during authoring. If this property is set to TRUE, the value of the Window objects 
type property determines how the window will appear during authoring. 

• If docki ngEnabl ed is TRUE and type is set to #document, the MIAW will look and act like a 
document windows in Director. The window will appear in the “view port” area and be 
dockable with the Stage, Score, and Cast windows, media editors, and message windows. 
However, the window will not be able to group with any of these windows. 

• IfdockingEnabledisTRUE and type is set to #tool, the MIAW will look and act like one of 
tool windows in Director. The window will be able to group with all tool windows except the 
Property inspector and the Tool palette. 

• If docki ngEnabl ed is TRUE and type is set to #di al og, the type is ignored and the window 
will be an authoring window. 

This property is ignored in projectors. 

Example 

These statements set the docki ngEnabl ed property to TRUE. 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.displayTemplate.dockingEnabled = TRUE -- from the Movie object

duration (Member) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
member Ob jRef. durati on 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef .durati on; 

Description 

Cast member property; determines the duration of the specified Shockwave Audio (SWA), 
transition, Windows Media, and QuickTime cast members. 

• When wh ; chCastMember is a streaming sound file, this property indicates the duration of the 
sound. The durati on property returns 0 until streaming begins. Setting preLoadTi me to 1 
second allows the bit rate to return the actual duration. 

• When wh ; chCastMember is a digital video cast member, this property indicates the digital 
video’s duration. The value is in ticks. 

• When wh ; chCastMember is a transition cast member, this property indicates the transition’s 
duration. The value for the transition is in milliseconds. During playback, this setting has the 
same effect as the Duration setting in the Frame Transition dialog box. 

This property can be tested for all cast members that support it, but only set for transitions. 

To see an example of duration used in a completed movie, see the QT and Flash movie in the

duration (RealMedia, SWA) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. durati on 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. durati on ; 

Description 

RealMedia or Shockwave audio sprite or cast member property; returns the duration of a 
RealMedia or Shockwave Audio stream, in milliseconds. The duration of the stream is not known 
until the cast member starts to play. If the stream is from a live feed or has not been played, the 
value of this property is 0. This property can be tested but not set. 

Example 

The following examples show that the duration of the RealMedia stream in sprite 2 and the cast 
member Real is 100,500 milliseconds (100.500 seconds). 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(2).duration) -- 100500

Description 

Sprite property; determines whether a specified sprite can be edited on the Stage (TRUE) or not 
(FALSE). Read/write. 

When the cast member property is set, the setting is applied to all sprites that contain the field. 
When this property is set, only the specified sprite is affected. 


editable 741 




You can also make a field sprite editable by using the Editable option in the Field Cast Member 
Properties dialog box. 

You can make a field sprite editable by using the Editable option in the Score. 

For the value set by a script to last beyond the current sprite, the sprite must be a scripted sprite. 

Example 

This handler first makes the sprite channel a puppet and then makes the field sprite editable: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on myNotes 

_movie.puppetSprite(5, TRUE) 
sprite(5).editabl e = TRUE 
end

elapsedTime 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

soundChannelObjRef .el apsedTime 

// JavaScript syntax 
soundChannelObjRef .el apsedTime; 

Description 

Sound Channel property; gives the time, in milliseconds, that the current sound member in a 
sound channel has been playing. Read-only. 

The elapsed time starts at 0 when the sound begins playing and increases as the sound plays, 
regardless of any looping, setting of the currentT i me or other manipulation. Use the 
currentTime to test for the current absolute time within the sound. 

The value of this property is a floating-point number, allowing for measurement of sound 
playback to fractional milliseconds. 

Example 

This idle handler displays the elapsed time for sound channel 4 in a field on the Stage 
during idles: 

-- Lingo syntax

member( whichCastmember ).model (whichModel) .shaderListl[ index ]},\ 
emissive 

Description 

3D #s t a n d a r d shader property; adds light to the shader independently of the lighting in the 
scene. For example, a model using a shader whose emi ssi ve property is set to rgb( 255 , 255 , 
255 ) will appear to be illuminated by a white light, even if there are no lights in the scene. The 
model will not, however, illuminate any other models or contribute any light to the scene. 

The default value for this property is rgb (0 , 0, 0). 

Example 

This statement sets the emissive property of the shader named Globe torgb(255, 0, 0).

enabled (sds) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model iwhichModel ).sds.enabled 

Description 

3D sds modifier property; indicates whether the sds modifier attached to a model is used by 
the model. 

The default setting for this property is TRUE. 

An attempt to add the sds modifier to a model that already has the inker or toon modifier 
attached fails without an error message. Likewise, an attempt to add the inker or toon modifier 
to a model that already has the sds modifier attached also fails without an error message. Be 
careful when using the sds modifier with the 1 od modifier. For more information, see the sds 
(modi fi er) entry. 

Example 

This statement turns on the sds modifier attached to the model Baby: 
member("Scene").model("Baby").sds.enabled = TRUE

enableFlashLingo 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.enableFlashLingo 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.enableFlashLingo; 

Description 

Movie property; determines whether a sprite with Flash content can make any direct scripting 
callbacks when using the Flash getURL( ) method. Read/write. 

The Flash getURL( ) method loads a new URL into a blank browser window. 

If enableFlashLingo is set to TRUE, a sprite with Flash content can execute any valid script 
command (subject to standard Shockwave Player-safe rules) when getURL( ) is called. 

If enabl e FI ashLi ngo is set to FALSE, a sprite with Flash content is prevented from executing 
script commands when getURL( ) is called. The default value of this property is FALSE. 

This property is useful when creating a movie that displays Flash content of unknown origin, 
such as in a projector that browses a system folder for SWF files, or a movie with Shockwave 
content that accepts a URL for a SWF file from an end user. 

Example 

This statement sets the enableFlashLingo property to TRUE: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.enableFlashLingo = TRUE

endAngle 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource( whichModelResource).\ 
endAngle 

Description 

3D #cyl i nder or #sphere model resource property; indicates how much of the sphere or 
cylinder is drawn. 

The surface of a sphere is generated by sweeping a 2D half circle arc around the sphere’s Y axis 
from sta rtAngl e to endAngl e. If startAngl e is set to 0 and endAngl e is set to 360, the result is 
a complete sphere. To draw a section of a sphere, set endAngl e to a value less than 360. 

The surface of a cylinder is generated by sweeping a 2D line around the spheres Y axis from 
startAngl e to endAngl e. If startAngl e is set to 0 and endAngl e is set to 360, the result is a 
complete cylinder. To draw a section of a cylinder, set endAngl e to a value less than 360. 

The default setting for this property is 360. 

Example 

For this example, assume that the cast member named MyMember contains a model that uses the 
model resource named Sphere4, whose endAngl e value is 310, leaving an opening of 50°. The 
handler closeSphere closes that opening in a way that makes it look like it is sliding shut. The 
repeat loop changes the endAngl e value of the sphere 1° at a time. The updateStage command 
in the repeat loop forces the Stage to redraw after every 1° increment. 

on closeSphere 

MyAngle = member!"MyMember").model resource("Sphere4"). endAngl e 
repeat with r = 1 to 50 
MyAngle = MyAngle + 1 

member!"MyMember").model resource!"Sphere4").endAngle = MyAngle 
updateStage 
end repeat

endTime 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
soundChannelObjRef. endTime 

// JavaScript syntax 
soundChannelObjRef. endTime; 

Description 

Sound Channel property; specifies the end time of the currently playing, paused, or queued 
sound. Read/write. 

The end time is the time within the sound member when it will stop playing. It’s a floating-point 
value, allowing for measurement and control of sound playback to fractions of milliseconds. The 
default value is the normal end of the sound. 

This property may be set to a value other than the normal end of the sound only when passed as a 
parameter with the queue!) or setPl ayLi st( ) methods.

error 


Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel ).sds.error 

Description 

3D #sds modifier property; indicates the percentage of error tolerated by the modifier when 
synthesizing geometric detail in models. 

This property works only when the modifiers subdivision property is set to #adapt i ve. The 
tension and depth (3D) properties of the modifier combine with the error property to control 
the amount of subdivision performed by the modifier. 


error 751 







Example 

The following statement sets the error property of the #sds modifier of the model named Baby 
to 0. If the modifier’s tension setting is low, its depth setting is high, and its subdivision 
setting is #adapti ve, this will cause a very pronounced effect on Baby’s geometry, 
member("Scene").model("Baby").sds.error = 0

eventPassMode 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. eventPassMode 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. eventPassMode; 

Description 

Flash cast member property and sprite property; controls when a Flash movie passes mouse events 
to behaviors that are attached to sprites that lie underneath the flash sprite. The eventPassMode 
property can have these values: 

• #passAl ways (default)—Always passes mouse events. 

• #passButton —Passes mouse events only when a button in the Flash movie is clicked. 

• #passNotButton —Passes mouse events only when a nonbutton object is clicked. 

• #passNever —Never passes mouse events. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

The following frame script checks to see whether the buttons in a Flash movie sprite are currently 
enabled, and if so, sets eventPassMode to #passNotButton; if the buttons are disabled, the script 
sets eventPassMode to #passAl ways. The effect of this script is the following: 

• Mouse events on nonbutton objects alwa.ys pass to sprite scripts. 

• Mouse events on button objects are passed to sprite scripts when the buttons are disabled. 
When the buttons are enabled, mouse events on buttons are stopped. 

-- Lingo syntax

The images of the models in the 3D world are mapped onto the projection plane, which is 
positioned in front of the camera like a screen in front of a movie projector. The projection plane 
is what you see in the 3D sprite. The top and bottom of the projection plane are defined by the 
f i el dOf V i ew property. Note, however, that the sprite is not resized as the value of the 
f i el dOf V i ew property changes. Instead, the image of the projection plane is scaled to fit the rect 
of the sprite. 


756 Chapter 14: Properties 



The value of this property is meaningful only when the value of the camera’s projection 
property is set to #perspecti ve. When the projecti on property is set to #orthographi c, use 
the cameras orthoHei ght property to define the top and bottom of the projection plane. 

The default setting for this property is 30.0. 

Example 

This statement sets the f i el dOf V i ew property of camera 1 to 90: 
member("3d world").camera[1].fieldOfView = 90

fileFreeSize 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.fi1eFreeSize 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.fi1eFreeSize; 

Description 

Movie property; returns the number of unused bytes in the current movie caused by changes to 
the cast libraries and cast members within a movie. Read-only. 

The Save and Compact and Save As commands rewrite the file to delete this free space. 

When the movie has no unused space, fi 1 eFreeSi ze returns 0. 

Example 

This statement displays the number of unused bytes that are in the current movie: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(_movie.fi 1 eFreeSi ze) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(_movie.fi 1 eFreeSi ze);

fileName (Cast) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
castObjRef. f i 1 eName 

// JavaScript syntax 
castObjRef. fi 1 eName; 

Description 

Cast library property; returns or sets the filename of a cast library. Read-only for internal cast 
libraries, read/write for external cast libraries. 


fileName (Cast) 757 



For external cast libraries, f i 1 eName returns the cast’s full pathname and filename. 

For internal cast libraries, f i 1 eName returns a value depending on which internal cast library 
is specified. 

• If the first internal cast library is specified, f i 1 eName returns the name of the movie. 

• If any other internal cast library is specified, f i 1 eName returns an empty string. 

This property accepts URLs as references. However, to use a cast library from the Internet and 
minimize download time, use the downl oadNetThi ng() or prel oadNetThi ng() methods to 
download the cast’s file to a local disk, and then set f i 1 eName to the file on the disk. 

If a movie sets the filename of an external cast, do no use the Duplicate cast members for Faster 
Loading option in the Project Options dialog box. 

Example 

This statement displays the pathname and filename of the Buttons external cast in the 
Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 

trace(castLib("Buttons").fi 1 eName) 

// JavaScript syntax 
trace(castLib("Buttons").fi1eName); 

This statement sets the filename of the Buttons external cast to Content.cst: 

-- Lingo syntax 

castLib("Buttons").fi 1 eName =_movie.path & "Content.cst" 

// JavaScript syntax 

castLib("Buttons").fi1eName =_movie.path + "Content.cst": 

The movie then uses the external cast file Content.cst as the Buttons cast. 

These statements download an external cast from a URL to the Director application folder and 
then make that file the external cast named Cast of Thousands: 

-- Lingo syntax 

downl oadNetThi ng(" http: //wwwcbDeMi He. com/Thousands . cst", \ 

_player.applicationPath & "Thousands . cst") 
castLib("Cast of Thousands").fi1eName = _player.applicationPath & \ 

"Thousands.cst" 

// JavaScript syntax 

downl oadNetThing("http://wwwcbDeMille.com/Thousands.cst", 

_player.applicationPath + "Thousands.cst"); 
castLib("Cast of Thousands").fi1eName = _player.applicationPath + 

"Thousands.cst";

fileName (Member) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef . fi 1 eName 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef .fi 1 eName; 

Description 

Member property; refers to the name of the file assigned to a linked cast member. Read/write. 

This property is useful for switching the external linked file assigned to a cast member while a 
movie plays, similar to the way you can switch cast members. When the linked file is in a different 
folder than the movie, you must include the file’s pathname. 

You can also make unlinked media linked by setting the filename of those types of members that 
support linked media. 

This property also accepts URLs as a reference. However, to use a file from a URL and minimize 
download time, use the down! oadNetThi ng() or prel oadNetThi ng() methods to download the 
file to a local disk first and then set the f i 1 eName property to the file on the local disk. 

After the filename is set, Director uses that file the next time the cast member is used. 

Example 

This statement links the QuickTime movie “ChairAnimation” to cast member 40: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member(40).fileName = "ChairAnimation" 

// JavaScript syntax 

member(40).fileName = "ChairAnimation"; 

These statements download an external file from a URL to the Director application folder and 
make that file the media for the sound cast member Norma Desmond Speaks: 

-- Lingo syntax 

downloadNetThing("http://wwwcbDeMille.com/Talkies.AIF", \ 

_player.applicationPath & "Talkies.AIF") 
membert"Norma Desmond Speaks").fi1eName = _player.applicationPath & \ 

"Talkies.AIF" 

// JavaScript syntax 

downloadNetThing("http://wwwcbDeMi11e.com/Talkies.AIF", 

_player.applicationPath + "Talkies.AIF"); 
member!"Norma Desmond Speaks").fi1eName = _player.applicationPath + 

"Talkies.AIF";

fileName (Window) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
windowObjRef .f i 1 eName 

// JavaScript syntax 
windowObjRef. f i 1 eName; 

Description 

Window property; refers to the filename of the movie assigned to a window. Read/write. 

When the linked file is in a different folder than the movie, you must include the file’s pathname. 

To be able to play the movie in a window, you must set the fi 1 eName property to the movie’s 
filename. 

The f i 1 eName property accepts URLs as a reference. However, to use a movie file from a URL 
and minimize the download time, use the downl oadNetThi ng() or prel oadNetThi ng() 
methods to download the movie file to a local disk first and then set fi 1 eName property to the file 
on the local disk. 

Example 

This statement assigns the file named Control Panel to the window named Tool Box: 

-- Lingo syntax 

window!"Tool Box").fi1eName = "Control Panel" 

// JavaScript syntax 

window!"Tool Box").fi1eName = "Control Panel": 

This statement displays the filename of the file assigned to the window named Navigator: 

-- Lingo syntax 

trace(window("Navi gator").fi 1 eName) 

// JavaScript syntax 

trace(window("Navi gator").fi1eName); 

These statements download a movie file from a URL to the Director application folder and then 
assign that file to the window named My Close Up: 

-- Lingo syntax 

downLoadNetThing("http://www.cbDeMi11e.com/Fi nal e.DIR", \ 

_player.applicationPath & "Finale.DIR") 
window("My Close Up").fi1eName = _player.applicationPath & "Finale.DIR" 

// JavaScript syntax 

downLoadNetThing("http://www.cbDeMi11e.com/Finale.DIR", 

_player.applicationPath + "Finale.DIR"); 
window("My Close Up").fi1eName = _player.applicationPath + "Finale.DIR";

flat 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .shader( whichShader) .flat 

member( whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel ).shader.flat 

member ( whichCastmember) .model( whichModel) .shaderLi st{[ index ]}.flat 

Description 

3D #standa rd shader property; indicates whether the mesh should be rendered with flat shading 
(TRUE) or Gouraud shading (FALSE). 

Flat shading uses one color per face of the mesh. The color used for the face is the color of its first 
vertex. Flat shading is faster than Gouraud shading. 

Gouraud shading assigns a color to each vertex of a face and interpolates the colors across the 
face in a gradient. Gouraud shading requires more time and calculation, but creates a smoother 
surface. 

The default value for this property is FALSE. 

Example 

The following statement sets the flat property of the shader named Wall to T RU E . The mesh of a 
model that uses this shader will be rendered with one color per face. 

member("MysteryWorld").shader!"Wall").flat = TRUE

floatPrecision 


Usage 

the floatPrecision 

Description 

Movie property; rounds off the display of floating-point numbers to the number of decimal places 
specified. The value of floatPrecision must be an integer. The maximum value is 15 
significant digits; the default value is 4. 

The fl oatPreci si on property determines only the number of digits used to display 
floating-point numbers; it does not change the number of digits used to perform calculations. 

• IffloatPrecisionisa number from 1 to 15, floating-point numbers display that number of 
digits after the decimal point. Trailing zeros remain. 

• If floatPrecision is zero, floating-point numbers are rounded to the nearest integer. No 
decimal points appear. 

• IffloatPrecisionisa negative number, floating-point numbers are rounded to the absolute 
value for the number of decimal places. Trailing zeros are dropped. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement rounds off the square root of 3.0 to three decimal places: 

the floatPrecision = 3 
x = sq rt(3.0) 
put x 
-- 1.732 

This statement rounds off the square root of 3.0 to eight decimal places:

The value of the property is a string of styles delimited by commas. Lingo uses a font that is a 
combination of the styles in the string. The available styles are plain, bold, italic, underline, 
shadow, outline, and extended; on the Macintosh, condensed also is available. 

Use the style plain to remove all currently applied styles. The parameter uhichCastMember can be 
either a cast member name or number. 

This property can be tested and set. 

To see an example of f ontSty 1 e used in a completed movie, see the Text movie in the Learning/ 
Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable named ol dStyl e to the current fontStyl e setting for the field 
cast member Rokujo Speaks: 

--Lingo syntax 

oldStyle = member/"Rokujo Speaks").fontStyle 
// JavaScript syntax 

var oldStyle = member/"Rokujo Speaks").fontStyle; 

This statement sets the fontStyl e member property for the field cast member Poem to 
bold italic: 

--Lingo syntax 

member("Poem").fontStyle = "bold, italic" 

// JavaScript syntax 

member("Poem").fontStyle = "bold, italic"; 

This statement sets the fontStyl e property of the third word of the cast member Son’s Names 
to italic:

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. foreCol or; 

Description 

Sprite property; returns or sets the foreground color of a sprite. Read/write. 

It is not recommended to apply this property to bitmap cast members deeper than 1-bit, as the 
results are difficult to predict. 

It is recommended that the newer color property be used instead of the foreColor property. 

Example 

The following statement sets the variable ol dCol or to the foreground color of sprite 5: 

-- Lingo syntax 

oldColor = spri te( 5). foreCol or 

// JavaScript syntax 

var oldColor = spri te( 5). foreCol or ; 

The following statement makes 36 the number for the foreground color of a random sprite from 
sprites 11 to 13:

frameRate 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. frameRate 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. frameRate; 

Description 

Cast member property; specifies the playback frame rate for the specified digital video, or Flash 
movie cast member. 

The possible values for the frame rate of a digital video member correspond to the radio buttons 
for selecting digital video playback options. 

• When the frameRate member property is between 1 and 255, the digital video movie plays 
every frame at that frame rate. The frameRate member property cannot be greater than 255. 

• When the frameRate member property is set to -1 or 0, the digital video movie plays every 
frame at its normal rate. This allows the video to sync to its soundtrack. When the frameRate is 
set to any value other than -1 or 0, the digital video soundtrack will not play. 

• When the frameRate member property is set to -2, the digital video movie plays every frame 
as fast as possible. 

For Flash movie cast members, the property indicates the frame rate of the movie created in Flash. 
This property can be tested but not set. 

Example 

This statement sets the frame rate of the QuickTime digital video cast member Rotating Chair to 
30 frames per second: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("Rotati ng Chair").frameRate = 30 
// JavaScript syntax 

membert"Rotating Chair").frameRate = 30; 

This statement instructs the QuickTime digital video cast member Rotating Chair to play every 
frame as fast as possible: 

-- Lingo syntax 

membert"Rotating Chair").frameRate = -2 
// JavaScript syntax 

membert"Rotating Chair").frameRate = -2; 

The following sprite script checks to see if the sprite’s cast member was originally created in Flash 
with a frame rate of less than 15 frames per second. If the movie’s frame rate is slower than 15 
frames per second, the script sets the playBackMode property for the sprite so it can be set to 
another rate. The script then sets the sprite’s f i xedRate property to 15 frames per second.

hotSpot 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. hotSpot 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. hotSpot; 

Description 

Cursor cast member property; specifies the horizontal and vertical point location of the pixel that 
represents the hotspot within the animated color cursor cast member whichCursorCastMember. 
Director uses this point to track the cursor’s position on the screen (for example, when it returns 
the values for the Lingo functions mouseH and mouseV) and to determine where a rollover 
(signaled by the Lingo message mouseEnter) occurs. 

The upper left corner of a cursor is point(0,0), which is the default hotSpot value. Trying to set a 
point outside the bounds of the cursor produces an error. For example, setting the hotspot of a 
16-by-16-pixel cursor to point(l6,l6) produces an error (because the starting point is 0,0, not 

U). 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This handler sets the hotspot of a 32-by-32-pixel cursor (whose cast member number is stored in 
the variable cursorNum) to the middle of the cursor: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on startMovie 

member(cursorNum).hotSpot = point(16,16) 
end

enters a QuickTime VR hot spot that is visible on the Stage. The QuickTime VR sprite receives 
the message first. The message has two arguments: the me parameter and the ID of the hot spot 
that the cursor entered. 

To clear the callback, set this property to 0. 

To avoid a performance penalty, set a callback property only when necessary.

the message first. The message has two arguments: the me parameter and the ID of the hot spot 
that the cursor entered. 

To clear the callback, set this property to 0. 

To avoid a performance penalty, set a callback property only when necessary. 

This property can be tested and set.

hyperlink 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
chunkExpression . hyperl i nk 

// JavaScript syntax 
chunkExpression . hyperl i nk; 

Description 

Text cast member property; returns the hyperlink string for the specified chunk expression in the 
text cast member. 

This property can be both tested and set. 

When retrieving this property, the link containing the first character of chunkExpressi on 
is used. 

Hyperlinks may not overlap. Setting a hyperlink over an existing link, even partially over it), 
replaces the initial link with the new one. 

Setting a hyperlink to an empty string removes it. 

Example 

The following handler creates a hyperlink in the first word of text cast member “MacroLink”. The 
text is linked to Macromedia’s website. 

--Lingo syntax 
on startMovie 

member("Macro Link").word[l].hyperlink = "http://www.macromedia.com" 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function startMovie!) { 

member!"MacroLink").getPropRef!"word", 1).hyperlink = 

”http://www.macromedia.com";

Description 

Text cast member property; returns a linear list containing all the hyperlink ranges for the 
specified chunk of a text cast member. Each range is given as a linear list with two elements, one 
for the starting character of the link and one for the ending character. 

Example 

This statement returns all the links for the text cast member Glossary to the message window: 
--Lingo syntax 

put(member("G1ossary").hyperlinks) -- [[3, 8], [10, 16], [41, 54]] 

// JavaScript syntax 

trace(member("G1ossary").hyperlinks); // [[3, 8], [10, 16], [41, 54]] 

hyperlinkState 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

chuckExpression. hyperl inkState 

// JavaScript syntax 
chuckExpression. hyperl i nkState; 

Description 

Text cast member property; contains the current state of the hyperlink. Possible values for the 
state are: [/normal, #acti ve, and #vi si ted. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Like hyperLi nk and hyperLi nkRange, the returned range of the link contains the first character 
of chunkExpressi on. 


794 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 


The following handler checks to see if the hyperlink clicked is a web address. If it is, the state of 
the hyperlink text state is set to #visited, and the movie branches to the web address. 

--Lingo syntax

idleHandlerPeriod 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.idleHandlerPeriod 


// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.idleHandlerPeriod; 

Description 

Movie property; determines the maximum number of ticks that passes until the movie sends an 
idle message. Read/write. 

The default value is 1, which tells the movie to send idle handler messages no more than 60 
times per second. 

When the playhead enters a frame, Director starts a timer, repaints the appropriate sprites on the 
Stage, and issues anenterFrame event. Then, if the amount of time set for the tempo has elapsed, 
Director generates an exi tFrame event and goes to the next specified frame; if the amount of 
time set for this frame hasn’t elapsed, Director waits until the time runs out and periodically 
generates an i dl e message. The amount of time between idle events is determined by 
i dl eHandl erPeri od. 

Possible settings for idleHandlerPeriod are: 

• 0—As many idle events as possible 

• 1—Up to 60 per second 


idleHandlerPeriod 795 




• 2—Up to 30 per second 

• 3—Up to 20 per second 

• n —Up to 60/« per second 

The number of i d 1 e events per frame also depends on the frame rate of the movie and other 
activity, including whether scripts are executing. If the tempo is 60 frames per second (fps) and 
the i dl eHandl erPeri od value is 1, one i dl e event per frame occurs. If the tempo is 20 fps, three 
idle events per frame occur. Idle time results when Director doesn’t have a current task to 
perform and cannot generate any events. 

In contrast, if the idleHandlerPeriod property is set to 0 and the tempo is very low, thousands 
of i d 1 e events can be generated. 

The default value for this property is 1. 

Example 

The following statement causes the movie to send an idle message a maximum of once 
per second: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.idleHandlerPeriod = 60 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.idleHandlerPeriod = 60;

idleLoadMode 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.idleLoadMode 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.idleLoadMode; 

Description 

Movie property; determines when the preLoad () and preLoadMember() methods try to load 
cast members during idle periods. Read/write. 

Idle periods can be one of the following values: 

• 0—Does not perform idle loading 

• 1—Performs idle loading when there is free time between frames 

• 2—Performs idle loading during idle events 

• 3—Performs idle loading as frequently as possible 

The i dl eLoadMode property performs no function and works only in conjunction with the 
preLoadl) and preLoadMember() methods. 

Cast members that were loaded using idle loading remain compressed until the movie uses 
them. When the movie plays back, it may have noticeable pauses while it decompresses the 
cast members. 


796 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 

This statement causes the movie to try as frequently as possible to load cast members designated 
for preloading by the preLoad and preLoadMember commands: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.idleLoadMode = 3 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.idleLoadMode = 3; 

See also 

on idle. Movie, preLoadO (Movie), preLoadMember() 

idleLoadPeriod 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.idleLoad Period 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.idleLoad Period; 

Description 

Movie property; determines the number of ticks that Director waits before trying to load cast 
members waiting to be loaded. Read/write. 

The default value for i dl eLoadPeri od is 0, which instructs Director to service the load queue as 
frequently as possible. 

Example 

This statement instructs Director to try loading every 1/2 second (30 ticks) any cast members 
waiting to be loaded: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.idleLoadPeriod = 30 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.idleLoadPeriod = 30; 

See also 

on idle. Movie 

idleLoadTag 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.idleLoadTag 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.idleLoadTag; 

Description 

Movie property; identifies or tags with a number the cast members that have been queued for 
loading when the computer is idle. Read/write. 


idleLoadTag 797 



The i dl eLoadTag property is a convenience that identifies the cast members in a group that you 
want to preload, and can be any number that you choose. 

Example 

This statement makes the number 10 the idle load tag: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.idleLoadTag = 10 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.idleLoadTag = 10; 

See also 

on idle. Movie 

idleReadChunkSize 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.idleReadChunkSize 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.idleReadChunkSi ze; 

Description 

Movie property; determines the maximum number of bytes that Director can load when it 
attempts to load cast members from the load queue. Read/write. 

The default value of i dl eReadChunkSi ze is 32K. 

Example 

This statement specifies that 500K is the maximum number of bytes that Director can load in 
one attempt at loading cast members in the load queue: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.idleReadChunkSize = (500 * 1024) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.idleReadChunkSize = (500 * 1024); 

See also 

on idle. Movie 

image (Image) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
imageObjRef. i mage 

// JavaScript syntax 
imageObjRef. image: 

Description 

Image property. Refers to the image object of a bitmap or text cast member, of the Stage, or of a 
window. Read/write for a cast member’s image, read-only for an image of the Stage or a window. 


798 Chapter 14: Properties 



Setting a cast member’s image property immediately changes the contents of the member. 
However, when getting the image of a member or window, Director creates a reference to the 
image of the specified member or window. If you make changes to the windows, the contents of 
the cast member or window change immediately. 

If you plan to make a lot of changes to an item’s i mage property, it is faster to copy the item’s 
image property into a new image object using the dupl i cate() method, apply your changes to 
the new image object, and then set the original item’s image to the new image object. For 
nonbitmap members, it is always faster to use the dupl i cate( ) method. 

Example 

This statement puts the image of cast member originalFlower into cast member newFlower: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"newFlower").image = member!"originalFIower").image 
// JavaScript syntax 

member!"newFlower").image = member!"originalFIower").image; 

These statements place a reference to the image of the stage into the variable my Image and then 
put that image into cast member flower: 

-- Lingo syntax 

mylmage = _movie.stage.image 

member("flower").image = mylmage 

// JavaScript syntax 

var mylmage = _movie.stage. image; 

member("flower").image = mylmage:

image (RealMedia) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. i mage 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. i mage ; 

Description 

RealMedia sprite or cast member property; returns a Lingo image object containing the current 
frame of the RealMedia video stream. You can use this property to map RealVideo onto a 3D 
model (see the example below). 

Example 

This statement copies the current frame of the RealMedia cast member Real to the bitmap cast 
member Still: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("Sti11").image = member!"Real").image 
// JavaScript syntax 

member("Sti11").image = member!"Real").image; 


image (RealMedia) 799 



image (Window) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
windowObjRef. image 

// JavaScript syntax 
windowObjRef. image; 

Description 

Window property; refers to the image object of a window. Read-only. 

When you get the image of a window, Director creates a reference to the image of the specified 
window. If you make changes to the image, the contents of the window change immediately. 

If you plan to make a lot of changes to the image property, it is faster to copy the image property 
into a new image object using the Member object’s duplicate!) method, apply your changes to 
the new image object, and then set the original item’s image to the new image object. For 
nonbitmap members, it is always faster to use the dupl i cate() method. 

Example 

These statements place a reference to the image of the Stage into the variable my Image, and then 
put that image into the window named Flower: 

-- Lingo syntax 

mylmage = _movie.stage. image 

window!"FIower").image = mylmage 

// JavaScript syntax 

var mylmage = _movie.stage.image; 

window("FIower").image = mylmage;

duplicate!) (Member), Window 

imageCompression 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.imageCompressi on 

memberObjRef. i mageCompressi on 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.imageCompression; 
memberObjRef. i mageCompressi on; 

Description 

Movie and bitmap cast member property; indicates the type of compression that Director applies 
to internal (non-linked) bitmap cast members when saving a movie in Shockwave Player format. 
Read/write. 


800 Chapter 14: Properties 



Valid values for i mageCompressi on include the following: 


Value Meaning 

♦standard Use the Director standard internal compression format. 

♦movieSetting Use the compression settings of the movie, as stored in the 

_movie. imageCompressi on property. This is the default value for image formats 
not restricted to standard compression. 

#jpeg Use JPEG compression. See imageQual i ty. 


You normally set this property in the Director Publish Settings dialog box. 

Example 

This statement displays in the Message window the imageCompressi on that applies to the 
currently playing movie: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(_movie.imageCompressi on) 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(_movie.imageCompressi on);

imageQuality, Movie 

imageEnabled 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. i mageEnabl ed 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. i mageEnabl ed ; 

Description 

Cast member property and sprite property; controls whether a Flash movie or vector shape’s 
graphics are visible (TRUE, default) or invisible (FALSE). 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This begi nSpri te script sets up a linked Flash movie sprite to hide its graphics when it first 
appears on the Stage and begins to stream into memory and saves its sprite number in a global 
variable called gStreami ngSpri te for use in a frame script later in the Score: 

-- Lingo syntax 
global gStreamingSprite 

on beginSprite me 

gStreamingSprite = me.spriteNum 
sprite(gStreamingSprite).imageEnabl ed = FALSE 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function beginSprite() { 

_globa1 . gStreamingSprite = this.spriteNum; 

sprite(_global.gStreamingSprite).imageEnabled = 0; 

1 


imageEnabled 801 






In a later frame of the movie, this frame script checks to see if the Flash movie sprite specified by 
the global variable gStreamingSprite has finished streaming into memory. If it has not, the 
script keeps the playhead looping in the current frame until 100% of the movie has streamed into 
memory. It then sets the imageEnabl ed property to TRUE so that the graphics appear and lets the 
playhead continue to the next frame in the Score. 

-- Lingo syntax 
global gStreamingSprite 
on exitFrame me 

if spritetgStreamingSprite).member.percentStreamed < 100 then 
_movie.go(_movie.frame) 
el se 

sprite(gStreamingSprite).imageEnabled = TRUE 
_movi e.updatestageO 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFrame!) { 

var stmSp = sprite(_global.gStreamingSprite).member.percentStreamed; 
if (stmSp < 100) { 

_movie.go(_movie.frame); 

} else I 

sprite(_global.gStreamingSprite).imageEnabled = 1; 

_movi e.updatestageO; 


imageQuality 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.imageQual ity 
memberObjRef. imageQual i ty 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.imageQuality; 
memberObjRef. imageQual i ty; 

Description 

Movie and bitmap cast member property; indicates the level of compression to use when a movies 
i mageCompressi on property is set to #j peg. Read/write during authoring only. 

The range of acceptable values is 0-100. Zero yields the lowest image quality and highest 
compression; 100 yields the highest image quality and lowest compression. 

You can set this property only during authoring and it has no effect until the movie is saved in 
Shockwave Player format. 

Example 

This statement displays in the Message window the imageQual i ty that applies to the currently 
playing movie: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(_movie.imageQual ity) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(_movie.imageQual ity);

immovable 


Usage 

member ( whichCastmember) .model iwhichModel ) .collision.!'mmovabl e 

Description 

3D #coll i si on modifier property; indicates whether a model can be moved as a result of 
collisions during animations. Specifying TRUE makes the model immovable; specifying FALSE 
allows the model to be moved. This property is useful as a way of improving performance during 
animation, because models that do not move do not need to be checked for collisions by Lingo. 

This property has a default value of FALSE. 

Example 

This statement sets the i mmovabl e property of the collision modifier attached to the first 
model of the cast member named Scene to TRUE: 

member("Scene").model[1].col 1isi on.immovable = TRUE 

See also 

collision (modifier) 

ink 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spri teObjRef. i nk 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. ink; 

Description 

Sprite property; determines the ink effect applied to a sprite. Read/write. 

Valid values of i n k are as follows: 


0-Copy 

32-Blend 

1-Transparent 

33-Add pin 

2-Reverse 

34-Add 

3-Ghost 

35-Subtract pin 

4-Not copy 

36-Background transparent 

5-Not transparent 

37—Lightest 

6-Not reverse 

38-Subtract 

7-Not ghost 

39-Darkest 

8-Matte 

40—Lighten 

9-Mask 

41-Darken 


ink 803 






In the case of 36 (background transparent), you select a sprite in the Score and select a 
transparency color from the background color box in the Tools window. You can also do this by 
setting the backColor property. 

If you set this property within a script while the playhead is not moving, be sure to use the Movie 
object’s updateStage() method to redraw the Stage. If you change several sprite properties—or 
several sprites—use only one updateStageO method at the end of all the changes. 

Example 

This statement changes the variable currentlnk to the value for the ink effect of sprite (3): 

-- Lingo syntax 
currentlnk = sprite(3).ink 

// JavaScript syntax 

var currentlnk = sprite(3).ink; 

This statement gives sprite (i + 1) a matte ink effect by setting the ink effect of the sprite property 
to 8, which specifies matte ink: 

-- Lingo syntax 
sprite(i + 1) .ink = 8 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(i + 1) .ink = 8;

inker (modifier) 

Syntax 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource! whichModelResource).\ 
inker .inkerModifierProperty 

model ResourceObjectReference . inker .inkerModifierProperty 

Description 

3D modifier; once you have added the #i nker modifier to a model resource (using 
addModi fi er) you can get and set #i nker modifier properties. 

The #i nker modifier adds silhouettes, creases, and boundary edges to an existing model; the 
#i nker properties allow you to control the definition and emphasis of these properties. 

When the #i nker modifier is used in conjunction with the #toon modifier, the rendered effect is 
cumulative and varies depending on which modifier was first applied. The list of modifiers 
returned by the modi fi er property will list #i nker or #toon (whichever was added first), but not 
both. The #i nker modifier can not be used in conjunction with the #sds modifier. 

The #i nker modifier has the following properties: 

• 1 i neCol or allows you to get or set the color of lines drawn by the inker. 

• si 1 houettes allows you to get or set whether lines are drawn to define the edges along the 
border of a model, outlining its shape. 

• creases allows you to get or set whether lines are drawn in creases. 

• creaseAngi e allows you to get or set the sensitivity of crease angle detection for the inker. 


804 Chapter 14: Properties 



• boundary allows you to get or set whether lines are drawn around the boundary of the surface. 

• 1 i neOffset allows you to get or set where lines are drawn relative to the surface being shaded 
and the camera. 

• useLi neOffset allows you to get or set whether 1 i neOffset is on or off. 

Note: For more detailed information about the following properties see the individual property 
entries.

interval 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. i nterval 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. i nterval ; 

Description 

Cursor cast member property; specifies the interval, in milliseconds (ms), between each frame of 
the animated color cursor cast member wh ichCursorCastMember. The default interval is 100 ms. 

The cursor interval is independent of the frame rate set for the movie using the tempo channel or 
the puppetTempo Lingo command. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

In this sprite script, when the animated color cursor stored in the cast member named Butterfly 
enters the sprite, the interval is set to 50 ms to speed up the animation. When the cursor leaves 
the sprite, the interval is reset to 100 ms to slow down the animation. 


interval 805 



-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseEnter 

member("Butterfly"). i nterval = 50 
end 

on mouseLeave 

member("Butterfly").interval = 100 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseEnter() { 

member("Butterfly").interval = 50; 

} 

function mouseLeave() { 

member("Butterfly").interval = 100; 

) 


invertMask 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. i nvertMask 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. i nvertMask; 

Description 

QuickTime cast member property; determines whether Director draws QuickTime movies in the 
white pixels of the movies mask (TRUE) or in the black pixels (FALSE, default). 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This handler reverses the current setting of the invertMask property of a QuickTime movie 
named Starburst: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on toggleMask 

member("Starburst").invertMask = not(member!"Starburst").invertMask) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function toggleMaskO { 

member("Starburst").invertMask = !(member("Starburst").invertMask);

isVRMovie 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. i sVRMovi e 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. i sVRMovi e; 

Description 

QuickTime cast member and sprite property; indicates whether a cast member or sprite is a 
QuickTime VR movie that has not yet been downloaded (TRUE), or whether the cast member or 
sprite isn’t a QuickTime VR movie (FALSE). 

Testing for this property in anything other than an asset whose type is #quickTimeMedia 
produces an error message. 

This property can be tested but not set. 

Example 

The following handler checks to see if the member of a sprite is a QuickTime movie. If it is, the 
handler further checks to see if it is a QTVR movie. An alert is posted in any case. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on checkForVR(theSprite) 

if sprite(theSprite).member.type = #quickTimeMedia then 
if sprite(theSprite).isVRMovie then 
_player.alert("This is a QTVR asset.") 
el se 

_player.alert("This is not a QTVR asset.") 
end i f 
el se 

_player.alert("This is not a QuickTime asset.") 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function checkForVRltheSprite) { 

var memType = sprite(theSprite).member.type; 
if (memType = "quickTimeMedia") { 

var isType = sprite(theSprite).isVRMovie; 
if (isType =1)1 

_player.alert("This is a QTVR asset."); 

} else { 

_player.alert("This is not a QTVR asset."); 

} else { 

_player.alert("This is not a QuickTime asset.");

itemDelimiter 

Usage 

the itemDelimiter 

Description 

Player property; indicates the special character used to separate items. 

You can use the i temDel imi ter to parse filenames by setting i temDel i mi ter to a backslash (\) 
in Windows or a colon (:) on the Macintosh. Restore the i temDel i mi ter character to a comma 
(,) for normal operation. 

This function can be tested and set. 

Example 

The following handler finds the last component in a Macintosh pathname. The handler first 
records the current delimiter and then changes the delimiter to a colon (:). When a colon is the 
delimiter, Lingo can use the last item of to determine the last item in the chunk that makes 
up a Macintosh pathname. Before exiting, the delimiter is reset to its original value. 

on getLastComponent pathName 
save = the itemDelimiter 
the itemDelimiter = 
f = the last item of pathName 
the itemDelimiter = save 
return f

key 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_key.key 

// JavaScript syntax 
_key.key; 

Description 

Key property; returns the value of the last key that was pressed. Read-only. 

The returned value is the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) value that is assigned to 
the key, not the numerical value. 

You can use key in handlers that perform certain actions when the user presses specific keys as 
shortcuts and other forms of interactivity. When used in a primary event handler, the actions you 
specify are the first to be executed. 

Note: The value of key isn’t updated if the user presses a key while Lingo or JavaScript syntax is in 
a loop. 

Use the sample movie Keyboard Lingo to test which characters correspond to different keys on 
different keyboards. 

Example 

The following statements cause the movie to return to the main menu marker when the user 
presses the q key. Because the keyDownScri pt property is set to checkKey, the on prepareMovi e 
handler makes the on checkKey handler the first event handler executed when a key is pressed. 
The on checkKey handler checks whether the q key is pressed and if it is, navigates to the main 
menu marker. 


key 809 



-- Lingo syntax 
on prepareMovie 

keyDownScript = "checkKey" 
end 

on checkKey 

if (_key.key = "q") then _movie.go("Main Menu") 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function prepareMovie() { 
keyDownScri pt = checkKeyO; 

! 


function checkKeyO { 
if (_key.key == "q") { 
_movie.go("Main Menu") 


This on key Down handler checks whether the last key pressed is the z key and if it is, calls the on 
addNumbers handler: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on keyDown 

if (_key.key = "z") then addNumbers 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function keyDownO { 
if (_key.key == "z") 1 
addNumbers();

keyboardFocusSprite 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.keyboardFocusSprite 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.keyboardFocusSprite; 

Description 

Movie property; lets the user set the focus for keyboard input (without controlling the cursors 
insertion point) on a particular text sprite currently on the screen. Read/write. 

This is the equivalent to using the Tab key when the a u t oT a b property of the cast member 
is selected. 

Setting key board Focus Spri te to -1 returns keyboard focus control to the Score, and setting it to 
0 disables keyboard entry into any editable sprite.

keyCode 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_key.keyCode 

// JavaScript syntax 
_key.keyCode; 

Description 

Key property; returns the numerical code for the last key pressed. Read-only. 

The returned value is the key’s numerical value, not the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) value. 

You can use keyCode to detect when the user has pressed an arrow or function key, which cannot 
be specified by the key property. 

Use the sample movie Keyboard Lingo to test which characters correspond to different keys on 
different keyboards. 

Example 

This handler uses the Message window to display the appropriate key code each time a key 
is pressed: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on enterFrame 

keyDownScript = put(_key.keyCode) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function enterFrameO { 

keyDownScript = put(_key.keyCode); 

1 


This statement checks whether the up arrow (whose key code is 126) was pressed and if it was, 
goes to the previous marker: 

-- Lingo syntax 
if (_key.keyCode = 126) then 
_movi e.goPreviousO 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_key.keyCode == 126) ( 

_movi e.goPreviousO; 

) 


This handler checks whether one of the arrow keys was pressed and if one was, responds 
accordingly: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on keyDown 

case (_key.keyCode) of 
123: TurnLeft 
126: GoForward 
125: Backup 
124: TurnRight

keyDownScript 

Usage 

the keyDownScript 

Description 

System property; specifies the Lingo that is executed when a key is pressed. The Lingo is written 
as a string, surrounded by quotation marks, and can be a simple statement or a calling script for 
a handler. 

When a key is pressed and the keyDownScri pt property is defined, Lingo executes the 
instructions specified for the keyDownScri pt property first. Unless the instructions include the 
pass command so that the keyDown message can be passed on to other objects in the movie, no 
other on keyDown handlers are executed. 

Setting the keyDownScri pt property performs the same function as using the when keyDown 
then command that appeared in earlier versions of Director. 

When the instructions you specify for the keyDownScri pt property are no longer appropriate, 
turn them off by using the statement set the keyDownScript to EMPTY. 

Example 

The following statement sets keyDownScri pt to if the key = RETURN then go to the 
frame + 1 . When this statement is in effect, the movie always goes to the next frame whenever 
the user presses the Return key. 

the keyDownScript = "if the key = RETURN then go to the frame + 1" 

The following statement sets keyDownScri pt to the custom handler wyCustomHandl er. A Lingo 
custom handler must be enclosed in quotation marks when used with the keyDownScri pt 
property. 

the keyDownScript = "myCustomHandler"

keyframePlayer (modifier) 

Syntax 

memberiwhichCastmember) .model (whi chModel) ,\ 
keyframePIayer . keyframePlayerModifierProperty 

Description 

3D modifier; manages the use of motions by models. The motions managed by the 

keyf ramePl ayer modifier animate the entire model at once, unlike Bones player motions, which 

animate segments of the model called bones. 

Motions and the models that use them must be created in a 3D modeling program, exported as 
W3D files, and then imported into a movie. Motions cannot be applied to model primitives 
created within Director. 

Adding the keyf ramePl ayer modifier to a model by using the addModi fi er command allows 
access to the following keyf ramePl ayer modifier properties: 

• pi ayi ng indicates whether a model is executing a motion. 

• pi ay Li st is a linear list of property lists containing the playback parameters of the motions 
that are queued for a model. 

• currentT i me indicates the local time, in milliseconds, of the currently playing or 
paused motion. 

• pi ayRate is a number that is multiplied by the scale parameter of the pi ay () or queue! ) 
command to determine the playback speed of the motion. 

• pi ay 1 i st. count returns the number of motions currently queued in the playlist. 

• rootLock indicates whether the translational component of the motion is used or ignored. 

• currentLoopState indicates whether the motion plays once or repeats continuously. 

• bl endTi me indicates the length of the transition created by the modifier between motions 
when the modifiers autoblend property is set to TRUE. 

• autoBlend indicates whether the modifier creates a linear transition to the currently playing 
motion from the motion that preceded it. 

• blendFactor indicates the degree of blending between motions when the modifier’s 
autoBl end property is set to FALSE. 

• 1 ockTransl ati on indicates whether the model can be displaced from the specified planes. 

• posi ti onReset indicates whether the model returns to its starting position after the end of a 
motion or each iteration of a loop. 

• rotati onReset indicates the rotational element of a transition from one motion to the next, 
or the looping of a single motion. 

Note: For more detailed information about these properties, see the individual property entries. 

The keyf ramePl ayer modifier uses the following commands: 

• pause halts the motion currently being executed by the model. 

• pi ay () initiates or unpauses the execution of a motion. 

• pi ayNext!) initiates playback of the next motion in the playlist. 

• queue () adds a motion to the end of the playlist. 


keyframePlayer (modifier) 813 



The key f ramePI ayer modifier generates the following events, which are used by handlers 
declared in the regi sterForEvent( ) and regi sterScri pt( ) commands. The call to the 
declared handler includes three arguments: the event type (either #animati onStarted or 
#ani mati onEnded), the name of the motion, and the current time of the motion. For detailed 
information about notification events, see the entry for registerForEventO. 

#ani mati onStarted is sent when a motion begins playing. If blending is used between motions, 
the event is sent when the transition begins. 

#ani mati onEnded is sent when a motion ends. If blending is used between motions, the event is 
sent when the transition ends.

keyUpScript 

Usage 

the keyUpScript 

Description 

System property; specifies the Lingo that is executed when a key is released. The Lingo is written 
as a string, surrounded by quotation marks, and can be a simple statement or a calling script for 
a handler. 

When a key is released and the keyUpScri pt property is defined, Lingo executes the instructions 
specified for the keyUpScri pt property first. Unless the instructions include the pass command 
so that the keyUp message can be passed on to other objects in the movie, no other on keyUp 
handlers are executed. 

When the instructions you’ve specified for the keyUpScri pt property are no longer appropriate, 
turn them off by using the statement set the keyUpScript to empty. 

Example 

The following statement sets keyUpScri pt to i f the key = RETURN then go the frame + 1. 
When this statement is in effect, the movie always goes to the next frame whenever the user 
presses the Return key. 

the keyUpScript = "if the key = RETURN then go to the frame + 1" 

The following statement sets keyUpScri pt to the custom handler myCustomHandler. A Lingo 
custom handler must be enclosed in quotation marks when used with the keyUpScri pt property. 

the keyUpScript = "myCustomHandler"

labelList 


Usage 

the 1 abel Li st 

Description 

System property; lists the frame labels in the current movie as a Return-delimited string (not a 
list) containing one label per line. Labels are listed according to their order in the Score. (Because 
the entries are Return-delimited, the end of the string is an empty line after the last Return. Be 
sure to remove this empty line if necessary.) 

Example 

This statement makes a list of frame labels in the content of the field cast member Key Frames: 
This handler determines the label that starts the current scene:

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model Resource( whichModelResource) .left 

Description 

3D #box model resource property; indicates whether the side of the box intersected by its -X axis 
is sealed (TRUE) or open (FALSE). 

The default value for this property is TRUE. 

Example 

This statement sets the 1 eft property of the model resource named Crate to FALSE, meaning the 
left side of this box will be open: 

member("3D Worl d" ).model Resource!"crate").1 eft = FALSE 

See also

Description 

Text cast member property; contains the number of pixels the left margin of chunkExpressi on is 
offset from the left side of the text cast member. 

The value is an integer greater than or equal to 0. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This line indents the first line of text cast member “theStory” by ten pixels: 
membert"theStory").1ine[l].1eftlndent = 10 

See also

length (3D) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model Resource( whichModelResource) .length 
vectorReference . 1 ength 

Description 

3D #box model resource, #pl ane model resource, and vector property; indicates the length in 
world units of the box or plane. 

The length of a box is measured along its Z axis. The default length of a box is 50. 

The length of a plane is measured along its Y axis. The default length of a plane is 1. 


820 Chapter 14: Properties 




The length of a vector is its distance in world units from vecto r(0, 0, 0). This is the same as 
the magnitude of the vector. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable myBoxLength to the length of the model resource named 
GiftBox. 

myBoxLength = member("3D World").model Resource!"GiftBox").1ength 

See also 

height (3D), width (3D), magnitude 

lengthVertices 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource( whichModelResource).\ 

1engthVertices 

Description 

3D #box and //plane model resource property; indicates the number of mesh vertices along the 
length of the box or plane. Increasing this value increases the number of faces, and therefore the 
fineness, of the mesh. 

The length of a box is measured along its Z axis. The length of a plane is measured along its 
Y axis. 

Set the renderStyl e property of a model’s shader to #wi re to see the faces of the mesh of the 
model’s resource. Set the renderStyl e property to # poi nt to see just the vertices of the mesh. 

The value of this property must be greater than or equal to 2. The default value is 4. 

Example 

The following statement sets the lengthVertices property of the model resource named Tower 
to 10. Nine triangles will be used to define the geometry of the model resource along its Y axis; 
therefore, there will be ten vertices. 

member("3D World").model Resource!"Tower").1engthVertices = 10 

See also 

length (3D) 

level 

Usage 

membert whichCastmember ).model (whichModel ) .lod.level 

Description 

3D 1 od modifier property; indicates the amount of detail removed by the modifier when its auto 
property is set to FALSE.The range of this property is 0.0 to 100.00. 

When the modifier’s auto property is set to TRUE, the value of the 1 evel property is dynamically 
updated, but cannot be set. 


level 821 



The #1 od modifier can only be added to models created outside of Director in 3D modeling 
programs. The value of the type property of the model resources used by these models is 
#f romFi 1 e. The modifier cannot be added to primitives created within Director. 

Example 

The following statement sets the level property of the 1 od modifier of the model Spaceship to 
50. lithe 1 od modifier’s auto property is set to FALSE, Spaceship will be drawn at a medium level 
of detail. If the 1 od modifier’s auto property is set to TRUE, this code will have no effect. 

member("3D World").model("Spaceship").1od.1evel = 50

lifetime 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource (mode 1 Resource ).lifetime 

Description 

3D #parti cl e model resource property; for all particles in a particle system, this property 
indicates the number of milliseconds from the creation of a particle to the end of its existence. 

The default value of this property is 10,000. 

Example 

In this example, ThermoSystem is a model resource of the type #parti cl e. This statement sets 
the 1 i feti me property of ThermoSystem to 90.0 This means each particle of ThermoSystem will 
exist for 90 milliseconds. 

member(8,2).model Resource!"ThermoSystem").1ifetime = 90.0

Description 

3D element; an object at a vector position from which light emanates. 

Example 

This example shows the two ways of referring to a light. The first line uses a string in parentheses 
and the second line uses the a number in brackets. The string is the light’s name and the number 
is the position of the light in the cast member’s list of lights.

lineColor 

Usage 

member ( whichCastmember) .model (.whichModel ). i nker . 1 i neCol or 
member! whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel ).toon.lineColor 

Description 

3D toon and inker modifier property; indicates the color of the lines drawn on the model by the 
modifier. For this property to have an effect, either the modifier’s creases, si 1 houettes, or 
boundary property must be set to TRUE. 

The default value for this property isrgb(0, 0, 0). 

Example 

This statement sets the color of all lines drawn by the toon modifier on the model named Teapot 
torgb(255, 0, 0 ), which is red: 

member("shapes").model("Teapot").toon.1ineColor = rgb(255, 0, 0) 

See also 

creases, silhouettes, boundary, lineOffset 

lineCount 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef . 1 i neCount 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. 1 i neCount; 

Description 

Cast member property; indicates the number of lines that appear in the field cast member on the 
Stage according to the way the string wraps, not the number of carriage returns in the string. 

Example 

This statement determines how many lines the field cast member Today’s News has when it 
appears on the Stage and assigns the value to the variable numberOf Li nes: 

--Lingo syntax 

numberOfLines = member!"Today's News").1ineCount 
// JavaScript syntax 

var numberOfLines = member!"Today’s News").1ineCount; 


lineCount 823 



lineDirection 


Usage 

member( whichCastMember). 1ineDirecti on 

Description 

Shape member property; this property contains a 0 or 1 indicating the slope of the line drawn. 

If the line is inclined from left to right, the property is set to 1; and if it is declined from left to 
right, the property is set to 0. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This handler toggles the slope of the line in cast member “theLine”, producing a see-saw effect: 

on seeSaw 

member("theLine").1ineDirecti on = \ 
not member!"theLine").1ineDirecti on 
end 

lineHeight 

Usage 

member! whichCastMember) . 1 i neHei ght 
the lineHeight of member whichCastMember 

Description 

Cast member property; determines the line spacing used to display the specified field cast 
member. The parameter whichCastMember can be either a cast member name or number. 

Setting the lineHeight member property temporarily overrides the system’s setting until the 
movie closes. To use the desired line spacing throughout a movie, set the lineHeight member 
property in an on prepareMovi e handler. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable ol dHei ght to the current lineHeight setting for the field cast 
member Rokujo Speaks: 

oldHeight = member!"Rokujo Speaks").1ineHeight

lineOffset 


Usage 

member ( whichCastmember) .model (.whichModel ). toon . 1 i neOff set 
member! whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel ) .inker. 1 ineOffset 

Description 

3D toon and inker modifier property; indicates the apparent distance from the model’s surface 
at which lines are drawn by the modifier. For this property to have an effect, the modifier’s 
useLi neOff set property must be set to TRUE, and one or more ofits creases, si 1 houettes, or 
boundary properties must also be set to TRUE. 

This range of this property is -100.00 to +100.00. Its default setting is -2.0. 

Example 

The following statement sets the lineOffset property of the toon modifier for the model named 
Teapot to 10. The lines drawn by the toon modifier on the surface of the model will stand out 
more than they would at the default setting of -2. 

member("shapes").model("Teapot").toon.1ineOffset = 10 

See also 

creases, silhouettes, boundary, useLineOffset , lineColor 

lineSize 

Usage 

member! whichCastMember) . 1 i neSi ze 
the lineSize of member whichCastMember 
sprite whichSpri te.lineSize 
the lineSize of sprite whichSprite 

Description 

Shape cast member property; determines the thickness, in pixels, of the border of the specified 
shape cast member displayed on the Stage. For nonrectangular shapes, the border is the edge of 
the shape, not its bounding rectangle. 

The lineSize setting of the sprite takes precedence over the lineSize setting of the member. If 
Lingo changes the member’s lineSize setting while a sprite is on the Stage, the sprite’s lineSize 
setting remains in effect until the sprite is finished. 

For the value set by Lingo to last beyond the current sprite, the sprite must be a scripted sprite. 
This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement sets the thickness of the shape cast member Answer Box to 5 pixels: 

member!"Answer Box").1ineSize = 5 

This statement displays the thickness of the border of sprite 4: 

thickness = sprite(4).1ineSize 

This statement sets the thickness of the border of sprite 4 to 3 pixels: 

sprite(4).1ineSize = 3 


lineSize 825 



linked 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. 1 i nked 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. 1 i nked ; 

Description 

Member property; controls whether a script, Flash movie, or animated GIF file is stored in an 
external file (TRUE, default), or inside the Director cast library (FALSE). Read/write for script, 
Flash, and animated GIF members, read-only for all other member types. 

When the data is stored externally in a linked file, the cast members path Name property must

Member 

loaded 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. 1 oaded 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. 1 oaded; 

Description 

Member property; specifies whether a specified cast member is loaded into memory (TRUE) or not 
(FALSE). Read-only. 

Different cast member types have slightly different behaviors for loading: 

• Shape and script cast members are always loaded into memory. 

• Movie cast members are never unloaded. 

• Digital video cast members can be preloaded and unloaded independent of whether they are 
being used. (A digital video cast member plays faster from memory than from disk.)

Example 


This statement checks whether cast member Demo Movie is loaded in memory and if it isn’t, goes 
to an alternative movie: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if member("Demo Movie").1oaded = FALSE then 
_movie.go(l, "Waiting.dir") 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax

member! whichCastmember) .camera (whichCamera) .backdropiindex].loc 
sprite! whichSprite) .camera{( index )).overl ay[index].loc 
member! whichCastmember) .camera( whichCamera ).overl ay[ index ].loc 

Description 

3D backdrop and overlay property; indicates the 2D location of the backdrop or overlay, as 
measured from the upper left corner of the sprite. 

This property is initially set as a parameter of the addBackdrop, addOverl ay, i nsertBackdrop, 
or insertOverlay command which creates the backdrop or overlay. 

Example 

This statement positions the first backdrop of the camera of sprite 2: 
sprite!2).camera.backdrop[l]. 1 oc = point(120, 120)

locH 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spri teObjRef. 1 ocH 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. 1 ocH; 

Description 

Sprite property; indicates the horizontal position of a sprites registration point. Read/write. 
Sprite coordinates are relative to the upper left corner of the Stage. 

To make the value last beyond the current sprite, make the sprite a scripted sprite. 


locH 827 



Example 

This statement puts sprite 15 at the same horizontal location as the mouse click: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(15).1ocH = _mouse.mouseH 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(15).1ocH = _mouse.mouseH;

lockTranslation 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model (.whichModel ) . bonesPlayer.X 
1ockT ranslation 

member( whichCastmember) .model( whichModel ).keyframe PI ayer.\ 

1ockT ranslation 

Description 

3D #bonesPl ayer and #keyf ramePl ayer modifier property; prevents displacement from the 
specified plane(s) except by the absolute translation of the motion data. Any additional 
translation introduced either manually or through cumulative error is removed. The possible 
values of #none, #x, #y, #z, #xy, #yz, #xz, and #al 1 control which of the three translational 
components are controlled for each frame. When a lock on an axis is turned on, the current 
displacement along that axis is stored and used thereafter as the fixed displacement to which the 
animation is relative. This displacement can be reset by deactivating that axis lock, moving the 
object, and reactivating that axis lock. 

In other words, it defines the axis of translation to ignore when playing back a motion. To keep a 
model locked to a ground plane with the top pointing along the z-axis, set lockTranslation to 
#z. The default value for this property is #none. 

Example 

This statement sets the lockTranslation property of the model named Walker to #z. 

member("ParkScene").model("Walker").bones PIayer.\ 
lockTranslation = #z

locV 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spri teObjRef. 1 ocV 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. 1 ocV ; 

Description 

Sprite property; indicates the vertical position of a sprite’s registration point. Read/write. 


828 Chapter 14: Properties 




Sprite coordinates are relative to the upper left corner of the Stage. 

To make the value last beyond the current sprite, make the sprite a scripted sprite. 

Example 

This statement puts sprite 15 at the same vertical location as the mouse click:

sprite(15).1ocV = _mouse.mouseV 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(15).1ocV = _mouse.mouseV;

locZ 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spri teObjRef. 1 ocZ 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. 1 ocZ ; 

Description 

Sprite property; specifies the dynamic Z-order of a sprite, to control layering without having to 
manipulate sprite channels and properties. Read/write. 

This property can have an integer value from negative 2 billion to positive 2 billion. Larger 
numbers cause the sprite to appear in front of sprites with smaller numbers. If two sprites have the 
same 1 ocZ value, the channel number then takes precedence for deciding the final display order 
of those two sprites. This means sprites in lower numbered channels appear behind sprites in 
higher numbered channels even when the 1 ocZ values are equal. 

By default, each sprite has a 1 ocZ value equal to its own channel number. 

Layer-dependent operations such as hit detection and mouse events obey sprites’ 1 ocZ values, so 
changing a sprites 1 ocZ value can make the sprite partially or completely obscured by other 
sprites and the user may be unable to click on the sprite. 

Other Director functions do not follow the 1 ocZ ordering of sprites. Generated events still begin 
with channel 1 and increase consecutively from there, regardless of the sprites Z-order. 

Example 

This handler uses a global variable called gHighestSprite which has been initialized in the 
startMovie handler to the number of sprites used. When the sprite is clicked, its locZ is set to 
gHighestSprite + 1, which moves the sprite to the foreground on the stage. Then gHighestSprite 
is incremented by 1 to prepare for the next mouseUp call. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseUp me 

global gHighestSprite 

sprite(me.spriteNum).locZ = gHighestSprite + 1 
gHighestSprite = gHighestSprite + 1 
end 


locZ 829 




// JavaScript syntax

lod (modifier) 

Usage 

member ( whichCastmember) .model (.whichModel ) .lod. 1 odModi fierProperty 

Description 

3D modifier; dynamically removes detail from models as they move away from the camera. 

This modifier can only be added to models created outside of Director in 3D modeling programs. 
The value of the type property of the model resources used by these models is #f romFi 1 e. All 
such models use detail reduction whether or not the 1 od modifier is attached. Attaching the 
modifier allows you to control the properties of detail reduction. The modifier cannot be added 
to primitives created within Director. 

The 1 od modifier data is generated by 3D modeling programs for all models. Setting the 
userData property "sw3d_no_l od = true" allows you to specify that the 1 od modifier data and 
memory be released when streaming is complete. 

Be careful when using the sds and 1 od modifiers together, because they perform opposite 
functions (the sds modifier adds geometric detail and the 1 od modifier removes geometric 
detail). Before adding the sds modifier, it is recommended that you disable the 1 od . a uto 
modifier property and set the 1 od . 1 evel modifier property to maximum resolution, as follows: 

member("myMember").model("myModel").1od.auto = 0 
member("myMember").model("myModel").1od.1evel = 100 
member("myMember").model("myModel").addmodifier(#sds) 

The 1 od modifier has the following properties: 

• auto allows the modifier to set the level of detail reduction as the distance between the model 
and the camera changes. The value of the modifier’s level property is updated, but setting the 
1 evel property will have no effect when the auto property is set to TRUE. 

• bias indicates how aggressively the modifier removes detail from the model when the 
modifier’s auto property is set to TRUE. The range for this property is from 0.0 (removes all 
polygons) to 100.0 (removes no polygons). The default setting for this property is 100.0. 

• level indicates the amount of detail reduction there will be when the modifier’s auto property 
is set to FALSE. The range of this property is 0.0 to 100.00. 

Note: For more detailed information about these properties, see the individual property entries.

loop (3D) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) . 1 oop 

Description 

3D cast member property; indicates whether motions applied to the first model in the cast 
member repeat continuously (TRUE) or play once and stop (FALSE). 

The default setting for this property is TRUE. 

Example 

This statement sets the loop property of the cast member named Walkers to TRUE. Motions 
being executed by the first model in Walker will repeat continuously. 

member("Walkers").1oop = TRUE 

See also 

moti on, pi ay () (3D), queueO (3D), animat ion Enabled 

loop (emitter) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model Resource! whichModelResource).\ 
emitter.1oop 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model resource whose type is #pa rti cl e, this property allows you 
to both get and set what happens to particles at the end of their lifetime. A loop value of TRUE 
causes particles to be reborn at the end of their lifetime at the emitter location defined by the 
emitter’s regi on property. A value of FALSE causes the particles to die at the end of their lifetime. 
The default setting for this property is TRUE. 

Example 

In this example, ThermoSystem is a model resource of the type #particle. This statement sets the 
emitter.loop property of ThermoSystem to 1, which causes the particles of ThermoSystem to be 
continuously emitted. 

member("Fires").modelResource("ThermoSystem").emitter.loop = 1

loop (emitter) 831 



loop (Member) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. 1 oop 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. 1 oop; 

Description 

Cast member property; determines whether the specified digital video, sound, or Flash movie cast 
member is set to loop (TRUE) or not (FALSE). 

Example 

This statement sets the QuickTime movie cast member Demo to loop: 

-- Lingo syntax 
member("Demo").1oop = 1 

// JavaScript syntax 
member("Demo").1oop = 1; 

loop (Flash) 

Usage 

sprite( whichFlashSprite). 1 oop 
the loop of sprite whichFlashSprite 
member (whichFlashMember) .loop 
the loop of member whichFlashMember 

Description 

Flash sprite and member property; controls whether a Flash movie plays in a a continuous loop 
(TRUE) or plays once and then stops (FALSE). 

The property can be both tested and set. 

Example 

This frame script checks the download status of a linked Flash cast member called NetFlash using 
the percentStreamed property. While NetFlash is downloading, the movie loops in the current 
frame. When NetFlash finishes downloading, the movie advances to the next frame and the loop 
property of the Flash movie in channel 6 is set to FALSE so that it will continue playing through 
to the end and then stop (imagine that this sprite has been looping while NetFlash was 
downloading). 

on exitFrame 

if member!"NetFlash").percentStreamed = 100 then 
sprite(6).1oop = FALSE 
go the frame + 1 
end i f

832 Chapter 14: Properties 



loop (Windows Media) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
windowsMediaObjRef. 1 oop 

// JavaScript syntax 
windowsMediaObjRef. 1 oop; 

Description 

Windows Media property. Determines whether a movie loops (TRUE, default) or not (FALSE) after 
completion. Read/write. 

Example 

This statement specifies that the cast member Classical should loop after completion: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"Classical"). 1 oop = TRUE 

// JavaScript syntax 

member("Classical").1oop = true; 

See also 

Windows Media 

loopBounds 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spr 7 teObjRef. 1 oopBounds 

// JavaScript syntax 
spr 7 teObjRef. 1 oopBounds ; 

Description 

QuickTime sprite property; sets the internal loop points for a QuickTime cast member or sprite. 
The loop points are specified as a Director list: [startTime, endTime], 

The sta rtTi me and endTime parameters must meet these requirements: 

• Both parameters must be integers that specify times in Director ticks. 

• The values must range from 0 to the duration of the QuickTime cast member. 

• The starting time must be less than the ending time. 

If any of these requirements is not met, the QuickTime movie loops through its entire duration. 

The loopBounds property has no effect if the movie’s loop property is set to FALSE. If the loop 
property is set to TRU E while the movie is playing, the movie continues to play. Director uses these 
rules to decide how to loop the movie: 

• If the ending time specified by loopBounds is reached, the movie loops back to the 
starting time. 

• If the end of the movie is reached, the movie loops back to the start of the movie. 


loopBounds 833 



If the 1 oop property is turned off while the movie is playing, the movie continues to play. 
Director stops when it reaches the end of the movie. 

This property can be tested and set. The default setting is [0,0]. 

Example 

This sprite script sets the starting and ending times for looping within a QuickTime sprite. The 
times are set by specifying seconds, which are then converted to ticks by multiplying by 60. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on beginSprite me 

sprite(me.spriteNum).loopBounds = [(16 * 60),(32 * 60)] 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function beginSprite() { 

sprite(me.spriteNum).loopBounds = 1ist((16 * 60),(32 * 60));

loopCount 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
soundChannelObjRef. 1 oopCount 

// JavaScript syntax 
soundChannelObjRef. 1 oopCount; 

Description 

Sound Channel property; specifies the total number of times the current sound in a sound 
channel is set to loop. Read-only. 

The default value of this property is 1 for sounds that are simply queued with no internal loop. 

You can loop a portion of a sound by passing the parameters 1 oopSta rtT i me, 1 oopEndT i me, and 
1 oopCount with a queue! ) or setPl ayLi st( ) method. These are the only methods for setting 
this property. 

If 1 oopCount is set to 0, the loop will repeat forever. If the sound cast member’s 1 oop property is 
set to TRUE, 1 oopCount will return 0. 

Example 

This handler queues and plays two sounds in sound channel 2. The first sound, cast member 
introMusic, loops five times between 8 seconds and 8.9 seconds. The second sound, cast member 
creditsMusic, loops three times. However, no #1 oopSta rtTi me and #1 oopEndTi me are specified, 
so these values default to the #sta rtTi me and #endTi me, respectively. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on playMusic 

sound(2).queue([#member:member ("introMusic"), #startTime:3000, \ 

#1 oopCount: 5 , #loopStartTime:8000, #1 oopEndTime:8900]) 
sound(2).queue([#member:member("creditsMusic"), #startTime:3000, \ 

#endTime:3000, #1oopCount:3])

// JavaScript syntax 
soundChannelObjRef. 1 oopEndTi me ; 

Description 

Sound Channel property; specifies the end time, in milliseconds, of the loop set in the current 
sound playing in a sound channel. Read-only. 

The value of this property is a floating-point number, allowing you to measure and control sound 
playback to fractions of a millisecond. 

This property can only be set when passed as a property inaqueueO orsetPlaylist!) 
command. 

Example 

This handler plays sound cast member introMusic in sound channel 2. Playback loops five times

Example 

This statement displays the list of markers in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(_movie.markerLi st) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(_movie.marker List); 

See also 

Movi e 

mask 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. mask 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. mask; 

Description 

Cast member property; specifies a black-and-white (1-bit) cast member to be used as a mask for 
media rendered direct to Stage with media appearing in the areas where the mask’s pixels are 
black. The mask property lets you benefit from the performance advantages of a direct-to-Stage 
digital video while playing a QuickTime movie in a nonrectangular area. The mask property has 
no effect on non-direct-to-Stage cast members. 

Director always aligns the registration point of the mask cast member with the upper left of the 
QuickTime movie sprite. Be sure to reset the registration point of a bitmap to the upper left 
corner, as it defaults to the center. The registration point of the QuickTime member cannot be 
reset from the upper left corner. The mask cast member can’t be moved and is not affected by the 
center and crop properties of its associated cast member. 

For best results, set a QuickTime cast member’s mask property before any of its sprites appear on 
the Stage in the on beginSprite event handler. Setting or changing the mask property while the 
cast member is on the Stage can have unpredictable results (for example, the mask may appear as 
a freeze frame of the digital video at the moment the mask property took effect). 


838 Chapter 14: Properties 



Masking is an advanced feature; you may need to experiment to achieve your goal. 

This property can be tested and set. To remove a mask, set the mask property to 0. 

Example 

This frame script sets a mask for a QuickTime sprite before Director begins to draw the frame: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on prepareFrame 

member!"Peeping Tom").mask = member!"Keyhole") 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function prepareFrame!) { 

member!"Peeping Tom").mask = member!"Keyhole");

maxlnteger 

Usage 

the maxlnteger 

Description 

System property; returns the largest whole number that is supported by the system. On most 
personal computers, this is 2,147,483,647 (2 to the thirty-first power, minus 1). 

This property can be useful for initializing boundary variables before a loop or for limit testing. 

To use numbers larger than the range of addressable integers, use floating-point numbers instead. 
They aren’t processed as quickly as integers, but they support a greater range of values. 

Example 

This statement generates a table, in the Message window, of the maximum decimal value that can 
be represented by a certain number of binary digits: 

on showMaxValues 
b = 31 

v = the maxlnteger 
repeat while v > 0 
put b && && v 

b = b-1 
v = v/2 
end repeat 
end 


maxlnteger 839 




maxSpeed 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource( whichModelResource). \ 
emitter.maxSpeed 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model resource whose type is #pa rti cl e, allows you to get and 
set the maximum speed at which particles are emitted. Each particle’s initial velocity is randomly 
selected between the emitters mi nSpeed and maxSpeed properties. 

The value is a floating-point number and must be greater than 0.0. 

Example 

In this example, ThermoSystem is a model resource of the type #parti cl e. This statement sets 
the maxSpeed property of ThermoSystem to 15, which causes the fastest particles of 
ThermoSystem to move fairly quickly. Within a given particle system, the faster a particle moves, 
the farther it will travel. 

member!"Fires").model Resource!"ThermoSystem").emitter.maxSpeed=15

media 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef .medi a 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef .medi a; 

Description 

Member property; identifies the specified cast member as a set of numbers. Read/write. 

Because setting this property can use large amounts of memory, it is best used during 
authoring only. 

You can use the media property to copy the content of one cast member into another cast 
member by setting the second member’s medi a value to the medi a value for the first member. 

For a film loop cast member, the medi a property specifies a selection of frames and channels in 
the Score. 

To swap media in a projector, it is more efficient to set the member sprite property. 


840 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 

This statement copies the content of the cast member Sunrise into the cast member Dawn by 
setting the medi a member property value for Dawn to the medi a member property value 
for Sunrise: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"Dawn").media = member("Sunrise").media 
// JavaScript syntax 

member!"Dawn").media = member("Sunrise").media; 

See also 

Member 

mediaReady 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef .medi aReady 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. medi aReady; 

Description 

Member property; determines whether the contents of a cast member, a movie or cast library file, 
or a linked cast member is downloaded from the Internet and is available on the local disk (TRUE) 
or not (FALSE). Read-only. 

This property is useful only when streaming a movie or cast library file. Movie streaming is 
activated by setting the Movie:Playback properties in the Modify menu to Play While 
Downloading Movie (default setting). 

For a demonstration of the medi aReady property, see the sample movie Streaming Shockwave in 
Director Help. 

Example 

This statement changes cast members when the desired cast member is downloaded and 
available locally: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if member!"background").mediaReady = TRUE then 
sprite(2).member = member!"background").number 
end i f

RealMedia and Windows Media cast member and sprite property; allows you to get a symbol 
representing the state of the RealMedia or Windows Media stream. Read-only. 

The value of this property can change during playback. 

Valid values for this property are as follows: 

• #cl osed indicates that the RealMedia or Windows Media cast member is not active. The 
medi aStatus value remains #cl osed until playback is initiated. 

• #connecti ng indicates that a connection to the RealMedia or Windows Media stream is 
being established. 


842 Chapter 14: Properties 








• #opened indicates that a connection to the RealMedia or Windows Media stream has been 
established and is open. This is a transitory state that is very quickly followed by #bufferi ng. 

• #bufferi ng indicates that the RealMedia or Windows Media stream is being downloaded into 
the playback buffer. When buffering is complete (percentBuf f ered equals 100), the stream 
begins to play if the pa used At Start property is FALSE. For more information, see 
percentBuf fered. 

• #pl ay i ng indicates that the RealMedia or Windows Media stream is currently playing. 

• #seeki ng indicates that play was interrupted by the seek command. 

• #pa us ed indicates that play has been interrupted, possibly by the user clicking the Stop button 
in the RealMedia or Windows Media viewer, or by a script invoking the pause! ) method. 

• #error indicates that the stream could not be connected, buffered, or played for some reason. 
The lastError property reports the actual error. 

Depending on the cast member’s state ( Real Medi a ) value, a different medi aStatus property 
value is returned. Each medi aStatus value corresponds to only one state value. 

Example 

The following examples show that the RealMedia element in sprite 2 and the cast member 
Real is playing. 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(2).mediaStatus) -- #playing 
put(member!"Real").mediaStatus) -- #playing 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(sprite(2).mediaStatus); // #playing

member (Sprite) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spri teObjRef. member 

// JavaScript syntax 
spriteObjRef. member; 

Description 

Sprite property; specifies a sprites cast member and cast library. Read/write. 

The member Sprite property differs from the spri teNum Sprite property, which specifies only the 
sprites number to identify its location in the cast library but doesn’t specify the cast library itself. 
The member property also differs from the Mouse object’s mouseMember property, which does not 
specify a sprite’s cast library. 

When assigning a sprite’s member property, use one of the following formats: 

• Specify the full cast member and cast library description ( spri teObjRef. member = 
member( intMemberNum {, castLibraryNameOrNum))). 

• Specify the cast member name {spri teObjRef. member = member! " stringMemberName"). 

• Specify the unique integer that includes all cast libraries and corresponds to the mouseMember 
property (spri teObj Ref. member = 132). 

If you use only the cast member name, Director finds the first cast member that has that name in 
all current cast libraries. If the name is duplicated in two cast libraries, only the first name is used. 

To specify a cast member by number when there are multiple casts, use the memberNum Sprite 
property, which changes the member’s position in its cast library without affecting the sprite’s cast 
library (spr i teObj Ref. memberNum = 10). 

The cast member assigned to a sprite channel is only one of that sprite’s properties; other 
properties vary by the type of media element in that channel in the Score. For example, if you 
replace a bitmap with an unfilled shape by setting the member Sprite property, the shape sprite’s 
1 i neSi ze property doesn’t automatically change, and you probably won’t see the shape. 

Similar sprite property mismatches can occur if you change the member of a field sprite to a 
video. It’s generally more useful and predictable to replace cast members with similar cast 
members. For example, replace bitmap sprites with bitmap cast members. 

Example 

This statement assigns cast member 3 of cast number 4 to sprite 15: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(15).member = member(3, 4) 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(15).member = member(3, 4); 


846 Chapter 14: Properties 




The following handler uses the mouseMember function with the sprite.member property to find if 
the mouse is over a particular sprite: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame 

mm = _mouse.mouseMember 
target = sprite(1).member 
if (target = mm) then 

putC'Above the hotspot.") 

_movie.go(_movie.frame) 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFramet) I 

var mm = _mouse.mouseMember; 
var target = sprite(1).member; 
if (target = mm) 1 

putC'Above the hotspot."); 

_movie.go(_movie.frame);

memorySize 

Usage 

the memorySize 

Description 

System property; returns the total amount of memory allocated to the program, whether in use or 
free memory. This property is useful for checking minimum memory requirements. The value is 
given in bytes. 

In Windows, the value is the total physical memory available; on the Macintosh, the value is the 
entire partition assigned to the application. 

Example 

This statement checks whether the computer allocates less than 500K of memory and, if it does, 
displays an alert: 

if the memorySize < 500 * 1024 then alert "There is not enough memory to run 
this movie."

meshDeform (modifier) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel) .meshDeform. propertyName 

Description 

3D modifier; allows control over the various aspects of the referenced model’s mesh structure. 
Once you have added the #mes h Deform modifier (using the addModifier command) to a model 
you have access to the following properties of the #meshDeform modifier: 

Note: For more detailed information about the following properties see the individual property entries 
referenced in the see also section of this entry. 

• face.count returns the total number of faces in the referenced model. 

• mesh . count returns the number of meshes in the referenced model. 

• mesh[ index] allows access to the properties of the specified mesh. 

Example 

The following statement displays the number of faces in the model named gbFace: 

put member("3D World") .model("gbFace").meshDeform.face.count 
-- 432 

The following statement displays the number of meshes in the model named gbFace: 

put member("3D World") .model("gbFace").meshDeform.mesh.count 
-- 2 

The following statement displays the number of faces in the second mesh of the model 
named gbFace: 

put member("3D World") .model("gbFace").meshDeform.mesh [2] .face.count 
-- 204

milliseconds 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_system.mi 11iseconds 

// JavaScript syntax 
_system.mi11iseconds; 

Description 

System property; returns the current time in milliseconds (1/1000 of a second). Read-only. 
Counting begins from the time the computer is started. 


848 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 

This statement converts milliseconds to seconds and minutes by dividing the number of 
milliseconds by 1000 and dividing that result by 60, and then sets the variable currentMi nutes 
to the result: 

-- Lingo syntax 

currentSeconds = _system.mi 11 i seconds/1000 
currentMinutes = currentSeconds/60 

// JavaScript syntax 

var currentSeconds = _system.mi 11 i seconds/1000 ; 
var currentMinutes = currentSeconds/60; 

The resolution accuracy of the count is machine and operating system dependent. 

This handler counts the milliseconds and posts an alert if you’ve been working too long: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on idle 

if (_system.mil1iseconds > (1000 * 60 * 60 * 4)) then 
_player.alert("Take a break") 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function idleO { 

if (_system.mi 11iseconds > (1000 * 60 * 60 * 4)) { 

_player.alert("Take a break");

minSpeed 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource( whichModelResource). 
emitter.minSpeed 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model resource whose type is #pa rti cl e, allows you to get and 
set the minimum speed at which particles are emitted. Each particles initial velocity is randomly 
selected between the emitter’s mi nSpeed and maxSpeed properties. 

The value is a floating-point number and must be greater than 0.0. 

Example 

In this example, ThermoSystem is a model resource of the type #parti cl e. This statement sets 
the mi nSpeed property of ThermoSystem to 5, which causes the slowest particles of 
ThermoSystem to move somewhat slowly. Within a given particle system, the slower a particle 
moves, the shorter the distance it will travel. 

member("Fires").model Resource("ThermoSystem").emitter.\ 
minSpeed = 5

missingFonts 

Usage 

member( textCastMember ).mi ssi ngFonts 

Description 

Text cast member property; this property contains a list of the names of the fonts that are 
referenced in the text, but not currently available on the system. 

This allows the developer to determine during run time if a particular font is available or not. 
This property can be tested but not set.

substituteFont 

mode (emitter) 

Usage 

member( uhichCastmember ).model Resource! whichModelResource).\ 
emitter.mode 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model resource whose type is #pa rti cl e, allows you to both get 
and set the mode property of the resources particle emitter. 

This property can have the value #burst or #stream (default). A mode value of #burst causes all 
particles to be emitted at the same time, while a value of #stream causes a group of particles to be 
emitted at each frame. The number of particles emitted in each frame is determined using the 
following equation: 

particlesPerFrame = resourceObject.emitter.numParticles \ 

(resourceObject.1ifetime x mi 11isecondsPerRenderedFrame) 

Example 

In this example, ThermoSystem is a model resource of the type #particle. This statement sets the 
emitter.mode property of ThermoSystem to #burst, which causes the particles of ThermoSystem 
to appear in bursts. To create a single burst of particles, set emi tter .mode = #burst and 
emi tter. 1 oop = 0. 

member!"Fires").model Resource!"ThermoSystem").emitter.mode = #burst

850 Chapter 14: Properties 



mode (collision) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel ).col 1 i si on.mode 

Description 

3D collision modifier property; indicates the geometry to be used in the collision detection 
algorithm. Using simpler geometry such as the bounding sphere leads to better performance. The 
possible values for this property are: 

• #mesh uses the actual mesh geometry of the model’s resource. This gives one-triangle precision 
and is usually slower than #box or #sphere. 

• #box uses the bounding box of the model. This is useful for objects that can fit more tightly in 
a box than in a sphere, such as a wall. 

• #sphere is the fastest mode, because it uses the bounding sphere of the model. This is the 
default value for this property. 

Example 

These statements add the collision modifier to the model named your Model and set the mode 
property to #mesh: 

member!"3d").model("yourModel").addModifier(#col 1 isi on) 
member!"3d").model("yourModel").col 1ision.mode = #mesh 

model 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .model (whichModel) 

member! whichCastmember) .model [index] 

member(whichCastmember).model.count 

member! whichCastmember) .model (whichModel) .propertyName 

member! whichCastmember) .model[index].propertyName 

Description 

3D command; returns the model found within the referenced cast member that has the name 
specified by wh i chMode 1, or is found at the index position specified by i ndex. If no model exists 
for the specified parameter, the command returns void. As model .count, the command returns 
the number of models found within the referenced cast member. This command also allows 
access to the specified model’s properties. 

Model name comparisons are not case-sensitive. The index position of a particular model may 
change when objects at lower index positions are deleted. 

If no model is found that uses the specified name or no model is found at the specified index 
position then this command returns void. 

Example 

This statement stores a reference to the model named Player Avatar in the variable thismodel: 
thismodel = member!"3DWorld").model("PIayer Avatar") 


model 851 



This statement stores a reference to the eighth model of the cast member named 3DWorld in the 
variable thismodel. 

thismodel = member!"3DWorld").model [8] 

This statement shows that there are four models in the member of sprite 1. 

put sprited).member.model.count 
-- 4 

modelA 

Usage 

col 1isionData.model A 

Description 

3D colli si onData property; indicates one of the models involved in a collision, the other model 
being model B. 

The col 1 i si onData object is sent as an argument with the #col 1 i deWi th and #col 1 i deAny 
events to the handler specified in the regi sterForEvent, regi sterScri pt, and 
setCol 1 isionCal 1 back commands. 

The #col 1 i deWi th and #col 1 i deAny events are sent when a collision occurs between models to 
which collision modifiers have been added. The resol ve property of the models’ modifiers must 
be set to TRUE. 

This property can be tested but not set. 

Example 

This example has three parts. The first part is the first line of code, which registers the 
#putDetai 1 s handler for the #col 1 i deAny event. The second part is the #putDetai 1 s handler. 
When two models in the cast member named MyScene collide, the #putDetai 1 s handler is 
called and the colli si onData argument is sent to it. This handler displays the model A and 
model B properties of the colli si onData object in the message window. The third part of the 
example shows the results from the message window. These show that the model named 
GreenBall was model A and the model named YellowBall was model B in the collision. 

member!"MyScene").registerForEvent(#collideAny, #putDetai1s, 0)

modelB 


Usage 

collisionData.modelB 

Description 

3D colli si onData property; indicates one of the models involved in a collision, the other model 
being model A. 

The col 1 i si onData object is sent as an argument with the #col 1 i deWi th and #col 1 i deAny 
events to the handler specified in the regi sterForEvent, regi sterScri pt, and 
setCol 1 i si onCal 1 back commands. 

The #col 1 i deWi th and #col 1 i deAny events are sent when a collision occurs between models to 
which collision modifiers have been added. The resol ve property of the models’ modifiers must 
be set to TRUE. 

This property can be tested but not set. 

Example 

This example has three parts. The first part is the first line of code, which registers the 
#putDetai 1 s handler for the #col 1 i deAny event. The second part is the #putDetai 1 s handler. 
When two models in the cast member named MyScene collide, the #putDetai 1 s handler is 
called and the col 1 i si onData argument is sent to it. This handler displays the model A and 
model B properties of the colli si onData object in the message window. The third part of the 
example shows the results from the message window. These show that the model named 
GreenBall was model A and the model named YellowBall was model B in the collision.

Sound channel and sprite property; for sound sprites, QuickTime digital video, and Xtra 
extensions that support cue points, indicates the number that identifies the most recent cue point 
passed in the sprite or sound. The value is the cue point’s ordinal number. If no cue points have 
been passed, the value is 0. 

Shockwave Audio (SWA) sounds can appear as sprites in sprite channels, but they play sound in a 
sound channel. It is recommended that you refer to SWA sound sprites by their sprite channel 
number rather than their sound channel number. 

Example 

This statement tells the Message window to display the number for the most recent cue point 
passed in the sprite in sprite channel 1:

QuickTime VR sprite. The property’s value can be #mi nQual i ty, #maxQual i ty, or 
#normal Qual i ty. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement sets the moti onQual i ty of sprite 1 to #mi nQual i ty. 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(1).motionQuality = #minQuality 
// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(1).motionQuality = symbol("minQuality"); 

mouseChar 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_mouse.mouseChar 

// JavaScript syntax 
_mouse.mouseChar; 

Description 

Mouse property; for field sprites, contains the number of the character that is under the pointer 
when the property is called. Read-only. 

The count is from the beginning of the field. If the mouse pointer is not over a field or is in the 
gutter of a field, the result is -1. 

The value of mouseCha r can change in a handler or loop. If a handler or loop uses this property 
multiple times, it’s usually a good idea to call the property once and assign its value to a 
local variable. 


mouseChar 859 



Example 


This statement determines whether the pointer is over a field sprite and changes the content of 
the field cast member Instructions to “Please point to a character.” when it is not: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_mouse.mouseChar = -1) then 

member!"Instructions").text = "Please point to a character.” 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_mouse.motiseChar == -1) { 

member!"Instructions").text = "Please point to a character. 

1 


This statement assigns the character under the pointer in the specified field to the variable 
currentChar: 

-- Lingo syntax 

currentChar = member(_mouse.mouseMember).char[_mouse.mouseChar] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var currentChar = member(_mouse.mouseMember).getProp! "char", 

_mouse.mouseChar);

mouseDown 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_mouse.mouseDown 

// JavaScript syntax 
_mouse.mouseDown; 

Description 

Mouse property; indicates whether the mouse button is currently being pressed (TRUE) or not 
(FALSE). Read-only. 

Example 

The following mouseEnter handler that is attached to a sprite calls one handler if the mouse is 
not down when the mouse enters the sprite, and calls a different handler if the mouse is not down 
when the mouse enters the sprite. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseEnter 

if (_mouse.mouseDown) then 
runMouseDownScri pt 
el se

mouseDownScript 

Usage 

the mouseDownScript 

Description 

System property; specifies the Lingo that is executed when the mouse button is pressed. The 
Lingo is written as a string, surrounded by quotation marks and can be a simple statement or a 
calling script for a handler. The default value is EMPTY, which means that the mouseDownScri pt 
property has no Lingo assigned to it. 

When the mouse button is pressed and the mouseDownScri pt property is defined, Lingo executes 
the instructions specified for the mouseDownScri pt property first. No other on mouseDown 
handlers are executed, unless the instructions include the pass command so that the mouseDown 
message can be passed to other objects in the movie. 

Setting the mouseDownScri pt property performs the same function as the when keyDown then 
command in earlier versions of Director. 

To turn off the instructions you’ve specified for the mouseDownScri pt property, use the statement 
set the mouseDownScript to empty. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

In this statement, when the user clicks the mouse button, the playhead always branches to the 
next marker in the movie: 

the mouseDownScript = "go next" 

In this statement, when the user clicks anywhere on the Stage, the computer beeps: 
the mouseDownScript = "if the clickOn = 0 then beep" 

The following statement sets mouseDownScri pt to the custom handler myCustomHandler. A 
Lingo custom handler must be enclosed in quotation marks when used with the 
mouseDownScri pt property. 

the mouseDownScript = "myCustomHandler"

mouseH 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_mouse.mouseH 

// JavaScript syntax 
_mouse.mouseH; 

Description 

Mouse property; indicates the horizontal position of the mouse pointer. Read-only. 

The value of mouseH is the number of pixels the cursor is positioned from the left edge of 
the Stage. 

The mouseH property is useful for moving sprites to the horizontal position of the mouse pointer 
and checking whether the pointer is within a region of the Stage. Using the mouseH and mouseV 
properties together, you can determine the cursor’s exact location. 

Example 

This handler moves sprite 10 to the mouse pointer location and updates the Stage when the user 
clicks the mouse button: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown 

sprite(10).1ocH = _mouse.mouseH 
sprite(10).1ocV = _mouse.mouseV 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDownO { 

sprite(10).1ocH = _mouse.mouseH; 
sprite(10).1ocV = _mouse.mouseV; 

1 


This statement tests whether the pointer is more than 10 pixels to the right or left of a starting 
point and, if it is, sets the variable Far to TRUE: 

-- Lingo syntax 
startH = 7 

if (abs(_mouse.mouseH - startH) > 10) then 
Far = TRUE 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
var startH = 7; 

if (Math.abs(_mouse.mouseH - startH) > 10) 1 
var Far = true;

mouseltem 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_mouse.mouseltem 

// JavaScript syntax 
_mouse.mouseltem; 

Description 

Mouse property; contains the number of the item under the pointer when the property is called 
and the pointer is over a field sprite. Read-only. 

An item is any sequence of characters delimited by the current delimiter as set by the 
i temDel i mi ter property. Counting starts at the beginning of the field. If the mouse pointer is 
not over a field, the result is -1. 

The value of the mouseltem property can change in a handler or loop. If a handler or loop relies 
on the initial value of mouseltem when the handler or loop begins, call this property once and 
assign its value to a local variable. 

Example 

This statement determines whether the pointer is over a field sprite and changes the content of 
the field cast member Instructions to “Please point to an item.” when it is not: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (mouse.mouseltem = -1) then 

member("Instructions").text = "Please point to an item." 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_mouse.mouseltem == -1) { 

member("Instructions") .text = "Please point to an item."; 

1 


This statement assigns the item under the pointer in the specified field to the variable 
currentltem: 

-- Lingo syntax 

currentltem = member(_mouse.mouseMember).item[_mouse.mouseltem] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var currentltem = member(_mouse.mouseMember),getProp("item", 

_mouse.mouseltem);

mouseltem 863 



mouseLevel 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri teObjRef. mouseLevel 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. mouseLevel ; 

Description 

QuickTime sprite property; controls how Director passes mouse clicks on a QuickTime sprite 
to QuickTime. The ability to pass mouse clicks within the sprite’s bounding rectangle can be 
useful for interactive media such as QuickTime VR. The mouseLevel sprite property can have 
these values: 

• #control 1 er —Passes clicks only on the movie controller to QuickTime. Director responds 
only to mouse clicks that occur outside the controller. This is the standard behavior for 
QuickTime sprites other than QuickTime VR. 

• #a 11 —Passes all mouse clicks within the sprite’s bounding rectangle to QuickTime. No clicks 
pass to other Lingo handlers. 

• #none —Does not pass any mouse clicks to QuickTime. Director responds to all mouse clicks. 

• #shared —Passes all mouse clicks within a QuickTime VR sprite’s bounding rectangle to 
QuickTime and then passes these events to Lingo handlers. This is the default value for 
QuickTime VR. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This frame script checks to see if the name of the QuickTime sprite in channel 5 contains the 
string “QTVR.” If it does, this script sets mouseLevel to #al 1; otherwise, it sets mouseLevel to 
#none. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on prepareFrame 

if sprite(5).member.name contains "QTVR" then 

sprite(5).mouseLevel = #all 
el se 

sprite(5).mouseLevel = #none 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function prepareFrame!) { 

var nm = sprite(5).member.name; 
var nmStr = nm.indexOf("QTVR"); 
if (nmStr != -1) { 

sprite(5).mouseLevel = symbol("al1"); 

} else 1 

sprite(5).mouseLevel = symbol("none"); 


864 Chapter 14: Properties 



mouseLine 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_mouse.mouseLine 

// JavaScript syntax 
_mouse.mouseLine; 

Description 

Mouse property; contains the number of the line under the pointer when the property is called 
and the pointer is over a field sprite. Read-only. 

Counting starts at the beginning of the field; a line is defined by Return delimiter, not by the 
wrapping at the edge of the field. When the mouse pointer is not over a field sprite, the result 
is -1. 

The value of the mouse Li ne property can change in a handler or loop. If a handler or loop uses 
this property multiple times, it’s usually a good idea to call the property once and assign its value 
to a local variable. 

Example 

This statement determines whether the pointer is over a field sprite and changes the content of 
the field cast member Instructions to “Please point to a line.” when it is not: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_mouse.mouseLine = -1) then 

member(" Instruct!'ons"). text = "Please point to a line." 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_mouse.mouseLine == -1) I 

member C Instruct!'ons"). text = "Please point to a line."; 

1 

This statement assigns the contents of the line under the pointer in the specified field to the 
variable current Li ne: 

-- Lingo syntax 

current Line = member(_mouse.mouseMember).1ine[_mouse.mouseLine] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var currentLine = member(_mouse.mouseMember).getProp( "1 ine", 

_mouse.mouseLine);

mouseLine 865 



mouseLoc 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_mouse.mouseLoc 

// JavaScript syntax 
_mouse.mouseLoc; 

Description 

Mouse property; returns the current position of the mouse as a point(). Read-only. 

The point location is given as two coordinates, with the horizontal location first, then the 
vertical location. 

Example 

The following statement displays the current position of the mouse. 

-- Lingo syntax 
trace(_mouse.mouseLoc) 

// JavaScript syntax 
trace(_mouse.mouseLoc); 

See also 

Mouse, mouseH, mouseV 

mouseMember 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_mouse.mouseMember 

// JavaScript syntax 
_mouse.mouseMember; 

Description 

Mouse property; returns the cast member assigned to the sprite that is under the pointer when the 
property is called. Read-only. 

When the pointer is not over a sprite, this property returns the result VOID (Lingo) or nul 1 
(JavaScript syntax). 

You can use this property to make a movie perform specific actions when the pointer rolls over a 
sprite and the sprite uses a certain cast member. 

The value of the mouseMember property can change frequently. To use this property multiple 
times in a handler with a consistent value, assign the mouseMember value to a local variable when 
the handler starts and use the variable. 


866 Chapter 14: Properties 




Example 


The following statement checks whether the cast member Off Limits is the cast member assigned 
to the sprite under the pointer and displays an alert if it is. This example shows how you can 
specify an action based on the cast member assigned to the sprite. 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_mouse.mouseMember = member!"Off Limits")) then 
_player.alert("Stay away from there!") 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 

if (_mouse.mouseMember = memberC'Off Limits")) { 

_player.alert("Stay away from there!"); 

I 


This statement assigns the cast member of the sprite under the pointer to the variable 
1 astMember: 

-- Lingo syntax 

1 astMember = _mouse.mouseMember 

// JavaScript syntax 

var lastMember = _mouse.mouseMember;

castLibNum, Mouse 

mouseOverButton 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef. mouseOverButton 

// JavaScript syntax 

spriteObjRef. mouseOverButton; 

Description 

Flash sprite property; indicates whether the mouse pointer is over a button in a Flash movie sprite 
specified by the whichFlashSpri te parameter (TRUE), or whether the mouse pointer is outside 
the bounds of the sprite or the mouse pointer is within the bounds of the sprite but over a 
nonbutton object, such as the background (FALSE). 

This property can be tested but not set. 

Example 

This frame script checks to see if the mouse pointer is over a navigation button in the Flash movie 
in sprite 3. If the mouse pointer is over the button, the script updates a text field with an 
appropriate message; otherwise, the script clears the message. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on enterFrame 

case sprite(3).mouseOverButton of 
TRUE: 

member!"Message Line").text = "Click here to go to the next page." 
FALSE; 

member!"Message Line").text = " " 
end case 


mouseOverButton 867 



_movie.updatestage() 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function enterFrame() { 

switch(sprite(3).mouseOverButton) 
case 1: 

member("Message Line").text = "Click here to go to the next page."; 
break; 
case 0: 

member("Message Line").text = " "; 
break;

_movi e.updatestageO; 

I 


mouseUp 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_mouse.mouseUp 

// JavaScript syntax 
_mouse.mouseUp; 

Description 

Mouse property; indicates whether the mouse button is released (TRUE) or is being pressed 
(FALSE). Read-only. 

Example 

This handler causes the movie to run as long as the user presses the mouse button. The playhead 
stops when the user releases the mouse button. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame me 

if (_mouse.mouseUp) then 
_movie.go(_movie.frame) 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFrameO { 
if (_mouse.mouseUp) { 

_movie.go(_movie.frame);

868 Chapter 14: Properties 



mouseUpScript 

Usage 

the mouseUpScript 

Description 

System property; determines the Lingo that is executed when the mouse button is released. The 
Lingo is written as a string, surrounded by quotation marks, and can be a simple statement or a 
calling script for a handler. 

When the mouse button is released and the mouseUpScri pt property is defined, Lingo executes 
the instructions specified for the mouseUpScri pt property first. Unless the instructions include 
the pass command so that the mouseUp message can be passed on to other objects in the movie, 
no other on mouseUp handlers are executed. 

When the instructions you’ve specified for the mouseUpScri pt property are no longer 
appropriate, turn them off by using the statement set the mouseUpScript to empty. 

Setting the mouseUpScri pt property accomplishes the same thing as using the when mouseUp 
then command that appeared in earlier versions of Director. 

This property can be tested and set. The default value is EMPTY. 

Example 

When this statement is in effect and the movie is paused, the movie always continues whenever 
the user releases the mouse button: 

the mouseUpScript = "go to the frame +1" 

With this statement, when the user releases the mouse button after clicking anywhere on the 
Stage, the movie beeps: 

the mouseUpScript = "if the clickOn = 0 then beep" 

This statement sets mouseUpScri pt to the custom handler myCustomHandl er. A Lingo custom 
handler must be enclosed in quotation marks when used with the mouseUpScri pt property. 

the mouseUpScript = "myCustomHandler"

mouseV 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_mouse.mouseV 

// JavaScript syntax 
_mouse.mouseV; 

Description 

Mouse property; indicates the vertical position of the mouse cursor, in pixels, from the top of the 
Stage. Read-only. 


mouseV 869 



The value of this property increases as the cursor moves down and decreases as the cursor 
moves up. 

The mouseV property is useful for moving sprites to the vertical position of the mouse cursor and 
checking whether the cursor is within a region of the Stage. Using the mouseH and mouseV 
properties together, you can identify the cursor’s exact location. 

Example 

This handler moves sprite 1 to the mouse pointer location and updates the Stage when the user 
clicks the mouse button: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown 

sprite(l) .locH = _mouse.mouseH 
sprite(l).locV = _mouse.mouseV 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDown!) { 

sprite(l).locH = _mouse.mouseH; 
sprite(1).1ocV = _mouse.mouseV ; 

1 


This statement tests whether the pointer is more than 10 pixels above or below a starting point 
and, if it is, sets the variable vFar to TRUE: 

-- Lingo syntax 
startV = 7 

if (abs(_mouse.mouseV - startV) > 10) then 
vFar = TRUE 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
var startV = 7 

if (Math.abs(_mouse.mouseV - startV) > 10) { 
var vFar = true;

locH, locV, Mouse, mouseH, mouseLoc 

mouseWord 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_mouse.mouseWord 

// JavaScript syntax 
_mouse.mouseWord; 

Description 

Mouse property; contains the number of the word under the pointer when the property is called 
and when the pointer is over a field sprite. Read-only. 


870 Chapter 14: Properties 




Counting starts from the beginning of the field. When the mouse is not over a field, the result 
is -1. 

The value of the mouseWord property can change in a handler or loop. If a handler or loop uses 
this property multiple times, it’s usually a good idea to call the function once and assign its value 
to a local variable. 

Example 

This statement determines whether the pointer is over a field sprite and changes the content of 
the field cast member Instructions to “Please point to a word.” when it is not: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_mouse.mouseWord = -1) then 

member!"Instructions").text = "Please point to a word." 
el se 

member!"Instructions").text = "Thank you." 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_mouse.mouseWord == -1) { 

member!"Instructions").text = "Please point to a word.": 

1 

el se ( 

member!"Instructions") .text = "Thank you.": 

1 


This statement assigns the number of the word under the pointer in the specified field to the 
variable currentWord: 

-- Lingo syntax 

currentWord = member(_mouse.mouseMember).word[_mouse.mouseWord] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var currentWord = member(_mouse.mouseMember).getProp! "word", 

_mouse.mouseWord);

House, mouseChar, mouseltem 

moveableSprite 

Usage 

sprite( whichSprite ).moveableSprite 
the moveableSprite of sprite whichSprite 

Description 

Sprite property; indicates whether a sprite can be moved by the user (TRUE) or not (FALSE). 

You can make a sprite moveable by using the Moveable option in the Score. However, to control 
whether a sprite is moveable and to turn this condition on and off as needed, use Lingo. For 
example, to let users drag sprites one at a time and then make the sprites unmoveable after they 
are positioned, turn the moveabl eSpri te sprite property on and off at the appropriate times. 

Note: For more customized control such as snapping back to the origin or animating while dragging, 
create a behavior to manage the additional functionality. 

This property can be tested and set. 


moveableSprite 871 



Example 

This handler makes sprites in channel 5 moveable: 

on spriteMove 

sprite(5).moveableSprite = TRUE 
end 

This statement checks whether a sprite is moveable and, if it is not, displays a message: 

if sprite(13).moveableSprite = FALSE then 

membert"Notice").text = "You can’t drag this item by using the mouse."

Description 

Window property; returns a reference to the movie object that is playing in a specified window. 
Read-only. 

Example 

This statement displays in the Message window the movie object that is playing in the window 
named Empires: 

-- Lingo syntax 

tracetwindow("Empires").movie) 

// JavaScript syntax

Description 

3D property; when used with an object reference, allows you to get the name of the referenced 
object. You can only get the name; the name can’t be changed. 

All names must be unique. If created through Lingo, the name returned is the name given in the 
constructor function. If created through a 3D-authoring program the name returned may be the 
name of the model. 

Example 

This statement sets the name of the fifth camera in the cast member TableScene to BirdCam:

name (Sprite) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spri teObjRef. name 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. name; 

Description 

Sprite property; identifies the name of a sprite. Read/write during a Score recording session only. 

Unlike sprite display properties such as backCol or and bl end, a sprite name cannot be a scripted 
sprite. This means that the name can only be set during a Score recording session—between calls 
to the Movie object’s begi nRecordi ng( ) and endRecordi ng( ) methods. You can only set the 
name if begi nRecordi ng( ) is called on or before a frame in the Score that contains the sprite. 

Note: Starting a Score recording session using begi nRecordi ng( ) resets the properties of all scripted 
sprites and sprite channels. 

If you use script to create a new sprite during a Score recording session and you use 
updateFramel ) to apply the sprite data to the session, you cannot set the sprite’s name until you 
go back to the frame in which the sprite was created. Use a method such as go () to go back to a 
specific frame. 

Example 

This statement sets the name of sprite 5 to Background Sound: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(5).name = "Background Sound" 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(5).name = "Background Sound"; 

See also 

beginRecording() , endRecording() , go() , Sprite, updateFrameC) 

name (Sprite Channel) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri teChannelObjRef. name 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teChannelObjRef. name; 

Description 

Sprite Channel property; identifies the name of a sprite channel. Read/write during a Score 
recording session only. 

Set the name of a sprite channel during a Score recording session—between calls to the Movie 
object’s begi nRecordi ng( ) and endRecordi ng( ) methods. 

Note: Starting a Score recording session using begi nRecordi ng( ) resets the properties of all scripted 
sprites and sprite channels. 


name (Sprite Channel) 875 



Unlike a Sprite object’s name property, which can only be set on or after a frame in which a 
sprite appears in the Score, a Sprite Channel object’s name property can be set on an empty 
channel. This means that you do not need to call updateFrame( ) before setting the name of 
the sprite channel. 

A change to a sprite channel’s name using script is not reflected in the Score window. 

Example 

This statement sets the name of sprite channel 6 to Kite String during a Score recording session: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown 

_movie.beginRecording() 
channel(6).name = "Kite string" 

_movie.end Recording() 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDown!) { 

_movie.beginRecordi ng();

nearFiltering 877 



Description 


3D texture property; allows you to get or set whether bilinear filtering is used when rendering a 
projected texture map that covers more screen space than the original texture source. Bilinear 
filtering smooths any errors across the texture and thus improves the texture’s appearance. Bilinear 
filtering smooths errors in two dimensions. Trilinear filtering smooths errors in three dimensions. 
Filtering improves appearance at the expense of performance, with bilinear being less 
performance-costly than trilinear. 

When the property’s value is TRUE, bilinear filtering is used. When the value is FALSE, bilinear 
filtering is not used. The default is TRUE. 

Example 

This statement turns offbilinear filtering for the texture named gbTexture in the cast 
member Scene: 

member("Scene").texture!"gbTexture").nearFi1tering = FALSE 

netPresent

Description 

QuickTime VR sprite property; contains the name of the handler that runs after the QuickTime 
VR movie switches to a new active node on the Stage. The message has two arguments: the me 
parameter and the ID of the node that is being displayed. 

The QuickTime VR sprite receives the message first. 

To clear the callback, set this property to 0. 


nodeEnterCallback 879 



To avoid a performance penalty, set a callback property only when necessary. 

This property can be tested and set. 

nodeExitCallback 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteObjRef .nodeExi tCal 1 back 

// JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. nodeExitCallback; 

Description 

QuickTime VR sprite property; contains the name of the handler that runs when the QuickTime 
VR movie is about to switch to a new active node on the Stage. The message has three arguments: 
the me parameter, the ID of the node that the movie is about to leave, and the ID of the node that 
the movie is about to switch to. 

The value that the handler returns determines whether the movie goes on to the next node. 

If the handler returns # conti nue, the QuickTime VR sprite continues with a normal node 
transition. If the handler returns #cancel, the transition doesn’t occur and the movie stays in 
the original node. 

Set this property to 0 to clear the callback. 

The QuickTime VR sprite receives the message first. 

To avoid a performance penalty, set a callback property only when necessary. 

This property can be tested and set. 

nodeType 

Usage

normalList 


Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource( whichModelResource). \ 
normal List 

model .meshDeform.mesh[i ndex].normal List 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model resource whose type is #mesh, this property allows you to 
get or set the normal List property of the model resource. 

The normal Li st property is a linear list of vectors from which you may specify vertex normals 
when building the faces of your mesh. 

This property must be set to a list of exactly the number of vectors specified in the 
newMesh( ) call. 

Alternately, the normal Li st property may be generated for you by the generateNormal s () 
method of mesh model resources. 

In the context of the meshDeform modifier, the normal Li st property is similarly a linear list of 
vectors from which you may specify vertex normals when deforming your mesh. 

For more information on face normals and vertex normals, see the norma 1 s entry. 

Example 

put member!5,2).model Resource!"mesh square"). normal List 
-- [vector!!),0,1)] 

member(2).model Resource!"mesh3").normal List[2] = vectorX 
(205.0000, -300.0000, 27.0000)

normals 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember ).model Resource! whichModelResource). \ 
face[ index ].normal s 

Usage 

3D face property; for model resources whose type is #mesh (created using the newMesh command) 
this property allows you to get and set the list of normal vectors used by the face specified by the 
index parameter. 

Set this property to a linear list of integers corresponding to the index position of each vertex’s 
normal in the model resource’s normal Li st property. 

This property must be set to the same length as the facet index], vert icies list, or it can be an 
empty list [ ]. 

Do not set any value for this property if you are going to generate normal vectors using the 
generateNormal s () command. 

If you make changes to this property, or a use the generateNormal s () command, you need to 
call the build! ) command in order to rebuild the mesh. 


normals 881 



Example 


This statement sets the normal s property of the fifth face of the model resource named Player to 
a list of integer values: 

member!“3D”).model Resource!“PIayer”).face[5].normals = [2,32,14]

member("3D Worid").model Resource!"Cylinder03").numSegments = 10 

obeyScoreRotation 

Usage 

member( flashMember ).obeyScoreRotation 

Description 

Flash cast member property; set to TRUE or FALSE to determine if a Flash movie sprite uses the 
rotation information from the Score, or the older rotation property of Flash assets. 

This property is automatically set to FALSE for all movies created in Director prior to version 7 in 
order to preserve old functionality of using the member rotation property for all sprites 
containing that Flash member. 

New assets created in version 7 or later will have this property automatically set to TRUE. 

If set to TRUE, the rotation property of the member is ignored and the Score rotation settings are 
obeyed instead. 

Example 

The following sprite script sets the obeyScoreRotation property of cast member "dalmation" to 1 
(TRUE), then rotates the sprite which contains the cast member 180°. 

on mouseUp me 

member("dalmation").obeyScoreRotation = 1 
sprite(1).rotation = sprite(1).rotation + 180 
end 

This property can be tested and set.

optionDown 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_key.optionDown 

// JavaScript syntax 
_key.optionDown; 

Description 

Key property; determines whether the user is pressing the Alt key (Windows) or the Option key 
(Macintosh). Read-only. 

This property returns TRUE if the user is pressing the Alt or Option key; otherwise, it 
returns FALSE. 


890 Chapter 14: Properties 



In Windows, opti onDown does not work in projectors if Alt is pressed without another 
nonmodifier key. Avoid using opti onDown if you intend to distribute a movie as a Windows 
projector and need to detect only the modifier key press; use control Down or shi ftDown instead. 

On the Macintosh, pressing the Option key changes the key value, so use keyCode instead. 

Example 

This handler checks whether the user is pressing the Alt or the Option key and, if so, calls the 
handler named doOpti on Key: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on keyDown 

if (_key.optionDown) then 
doOption Key(_key.key) 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax

the sprite will not display correctly. 


originMode 893 



Example 


This sprite script uses the ori gi nMode property to set up a Flash movie sprite so its origin point 
can be set to a specific point. It then sets the horizontal and vertical origin points.

originPoint 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. ori gi nPoi nt 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. ori gi nPoi nt; 

Description 

Cast member and sprite property; controls the origin point around which scaling and rotation 
occurs of a Flash movie or vector shape. 

The ori gi nPoi nt property is specified as a Director point value: for example, point( 100,200). 
Setting a Flash movie or vector shape’s origin point with the originPoint property is the same as 
setting the originH and originV properties separately. For example, setting the originPoint 
property to point(50,75) is the same as setting the ori gi nH property to 50 and the ori gi nV 
property to 75. 

Director point values specified for the originPoint property are restricted to integers, 
whereas originH and originV can be specified with floating-point numbers. When you test 
the originPoint property, the point values are truncated to integers. As a rule of thumb, use 
the originH and originV properties for precision; use the originPoint property for speed 
and convenience. 

You can set the ori gi nPoi nt property only if the ori gi nMode property is set to #poi nt. 

This property can be tested and set. The default value is 0. 

Note: This property must be set to the default value if the scaleMode property is set to fautoSize, or 
the sprite will not display correctly.

originV 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. ori gi nv 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. ori gi nV ; 

Description 

Cast member and sprite property; controls the vertical coordinate of a Flash movie or vector 
shape’s origin point around which scaling and rotation occurs, in pixels. The value can be a 
floating-point value. 

The origin point can be set with floating-point precision using the separate originH and originV 
properties, or it can be set with integer precision using the single originPoint property. 

You can set the ori gi nV property only if the ori gi nMode property is set to #poi nt. 

This property can be tested and set. The default value is 0. 

Note: This property must be set to the default value if the scaleMode property is set to fautoSize, or 
the sprite does not display correctly.

orthoHeight 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .camera! whichCamera ).orthoHeight 
member! whichCastmember) .camera[camera index].orthoHeight 
sprite! whichSprite). camera.orthoHeight 

Description 

3D property; when camera . proj ecti on is set to #orthographi c, the value 
camera . orthoHei ght gives the number of perpendicular world units that fit vertically in the 
sprite. World units are the measuring units for the particular 3D world. They are internally 
consistent but arbitrarily chosen, and they can vary from one 3D world to another. 

You do not need to specify the camera index {whichCamera) to access the first camera of 
the sprite. 

The default value of this property is 200.0 

Example 

The following statement sets the orthoHei ght of the camera of sprite 5 to 200. This means 200 
world units will fit vertically within the sprite. 

sprite!5).camera.orthoheight = 200.0

overlay 

Usage 

memberiwhichCastmember). camera (wh1chCamera),\ 
overl ayLoverlaylndex ] .propertyName 
member( whichCastmember) .camera( whichCamera) .overl ay. count 

Description 

3D camera property; allows both get and set access to the properties of overlays contained in the 
camera’s list of overlays to be displayed. When used as overl ay . count this property returns the 
total number of overlays contained in the camera’s list of overlays to be displayed. 

Overlays are textures displayed in front of all models appearing in a given camera’s view frustum. 
The overlays are drawn in the order that they appear in the camera’s overlay list, the first item in 
the list appears behind all other overlays and the last item in the list in front of all other overlays. 

Each overlay in the camera’s list of overlays list has the following properties: 

• 1 oc allows you to get or set the specific position of the overlay’s regPoi nt, relative to the 
camera rect’s upper left corner. 

• source allows you to get or set the texture to use as the source image for the overlay. 

• scale allows you to get or set the scale value used by the overlay. The scale determines the 
magnification of the overlay; this property defaults to a value of 1.0. 

• rotation allows you to get or set the rotation, in degrees, of the overlay. 

• regPoi nt allows you to get or set the registration point of the overlay relative to the texture’s 
upper left corner. 

• blend allows you to get or set the blending of the overlay to an integer between 0 and 100, 
indicating how transparent (0) or opaque (100) the overlay is. 

Example 

This statement displays the scale property of the third overlay in the sprite camera’s overlay list: 

put sprite(5).camera.overlay[3].scale 
-- 0.5000

pageHeight 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. pageHei ght 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. pageHei ght; 

Description 

Field cast member property; returns the height, in pixels, of the area of the field cast member that 
is visible on the Stage. 

This property can be tested but not set. 


pageHeight 897 



Example 

This statement returns the height of the visible portion of the field cast member Todays News: 
--Lingo syntax 

trace!member("Today's News").pageHeight) 

// JavaScript syntax 

trace (member! "Today's News ").pageHeight); 

palette 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. pal ette 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. pal ette; 

Description 

Cast member property; for bitmap cast members only, determines which palette is associated with 
the cast member specified by wh ichCastMember. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement displays the palette assigned to the cast member Leaves in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(member("Leaves").palette) 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(member("Leaves").palette); 

paletteMapping 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.paletteMapping 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.paletteMapping; 

Description 

Movie property; determines whether the movie remaps (TRUE) or does not remap (FALSE, 
default) palettes for cast members whose palettes are different from the current movie palette. 
Read/write. 

The effect of this property is similar to that of the Remap Palettes When Needed check box in the 
Movie Properties dialog box. 

To display different bitmaps with different palettes simultaneously, set pal etteMappi ng to TRUE. 
Director looks at each onscreen cast member’s reference palette (the palette assigned in its Cast 
Member Properties dialog box) and, if it is different from the current palette, finds the closest 
match for each pixel in the new palette. 


898 Chapter 14: Properties 



The colors of the nonmatching bitmap will be close to the original colors. 

Remapping consumes processor time, and it’s usually better to adjust the bitmap’s palette 
in advance. 

Remapping can also produce undesirable results. If the palette changes in the middle of a sprite 
span, the bitmap immediately remaps to the new palette and appears in the wrong colors. 
However, if anything refreshes the screen—a transition or a sprite moving across the Stage—then 
the affected rectangle on the screen appears in remapped colors. 

Example 

This statement tells the movie to remap the movie’s palette whenever necessary: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.paletteMapping = TRUE 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.paletteMapping = true;

Movi e 

paletteRef 

Usage 

member! whichCastMember ). paletteRef 
the paletteRef 

Description 

Bitmap cast member property; determines the palette associated with a bitmap cast member. 
Built-in Director palettes are indicated by symbols (#systemMac, #rai nbow, and so on). Palettes 
that are cast members are treated as cast member references. This behavior differs from that of the 
pal ette member property, which returns a positive number for cast palettes and negative 
numbers for built-in Director palettes. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement assigns the Macintosh system palette to the bitmap cast member Shell: 

member!"Shell").paletteRef = #systemMac 


pan 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
soundChannelObjRef .pan 

// JavaScript syntax 
soundChannelObjRef. pan; 

Description 

Sound Channel property; indicates the left/right balance of the sound playing in a sound channel. 
Read/write. 


pan 899 



The range of values is from -100 to 100. -100 indicates only the left channel is heard. 100 
indicate only the right channel is being heard. A value of 0 indicates even left/right balance, 
causing the sound source to appear to be centered. For mono sounds, pan affects which speaker 
(left or right) the sound plays through. 

You can change the pan of a sound object at any time, but if the sound channel is currently 
performing a fade, the new pan setting doesn’t take effect until the fade is complete. 

To see an example of pan used in a completed movie, see the Sound Control movie in the 
Learning/Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

These statements pan the sound in sound channel 2 from the left channel to the right channel: 

-- Lingo syntax 
repeat with x = -100 to 100 
sound(2) .pan = x 
end repeat 

// JavaScript syntax 
for (var x = -100; x <= 100; x++) { 
sound(2).pan = x;

in degrees. 

This property can be tested and set. 

paragraph 

Usage 

chunkExpression. paragraph [whichParagraphl 
chunkExpression . paragraph!! f7 rstParagraph. . 1 astParagraph] 

Description

member! whichCastmember) .camera! whichCamera) .parent 
member! whichCastmember). 1 i ght! whichLight). parent 
member! whichCastmember) .group! whichGroup) .parent 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model, camera, light or group reference, this property allows you 
to get or set the parent node of the referenced object. The parent node can be any other model, 
camera, light or group object. 

An object’s transform property defines its scale, position and orientation relative to its 
parent object. 

Setting an objects parent property to VOID is the same as removing the object from the world 
using the removeFromWorl d( ) command. 

Setting an object’s parent property to the World group object (group! "Worl d" )) is the same as 
adding an object to the world using the addToWorl d( ) command. 

You can also alter the value of this property by using the addChi 1 d command. 

Example 

The following statement sets the parent property of the model named Tire. Its parent is set to the 
model named Car. 

member!"Scene").model("Tire").parent = \ 
member!"Scene").model ("Car")

password 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. password 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. password; 

Description 

RealMedia sprite and cast member property; allows you to set the password required to access a 
protected RealMedia stream. For security reasons, you cannot use this property to retrieve a 
password previously specified for this property. If a password has been set previously, the value of 
this property is the string ''********". If no password has been set, the value of this property is 
an empty string. 


password 901 



Example 


The following examples show that the password has been set for the RealMedia stream in the cast 
member Real or sprite 2. 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(2).password) -- "********" 
put(member("Real").password) -- "********" 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(sprite(2).password); // "********" 

put(member("Real").password); // "********" 

The following examples show that the password has never been set for the RealMedia stream in 
the cast member Real or sprite 2. 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(2).password) -- "" 

put(member("Real").password) -- "" 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(sprite(2).password); // "" 

put(member("Real").password); // "" 

The following examples set the password for the RealMedia stream in sprite 2 and the cast 
member Real to "abracadabra". 

-- Lingo syntax 

spritel 2).password = "abracadabra" 
member("Real").password = "abracadabra" 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(2).password = "abracadabra"; 

member("Real").password = "abracadabra";

path (Movie) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.path 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.path; 

Description 

Movie property; indicates the pathname of the folder in which the current movie is located. 
Read-only. 

For pathnames that work on both Windows and Macintosh computers, use the @ pathname 
operator. 

To see an example of path used in a completed movie, see the Read and Write Text movie in the 
Learning/Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder.

path (3D) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource! whichModelResource).\ 
emitter.path 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model resource whose type is #parti cl e, allows you to get or set 
the path property of the resource’s particle emitter. 

This property is a list of vectors that define the path particles follow over their lifetime. The 
default value of this property is an empty list [ ]. 

Example 

In this example, ThermoSystem is a model resource of the type #particle. This statement specifies 
that the particles of ThermoSystem will follow the path outlined by the list of vectors. 

member!"Fires").model Resource!"ThermoSystem").emitter.path = \ 

[vector(0,0,0), vector!15,0,0), vector(30,30,-10)]

pathName (Flash member) 

Usage 

member! whichFlashMember ).pathName 
the pathName of member whichFlashMember 

Description 

Cast member property; controls the location of an external file that stores the assets of a Flash 
movie cast member are stored. You can link a Flash movie to any path on a local or network drive 
or to a URL. 


pathName (Flash member) 903 




Setting the path of an unlinked cast member converts it to a linked cast member. 

This property can be tested and set. The pathName property of an unlinked member is an 
empty string. 

This property is the same as the f i 1 eName property for other member types, and you can use 
f i 1 eName instead of pathName. 

Example 

The following startMovi e script creates a new Flash cast member using the new command, sets 
the newly created cast members 1 i nked property so that the cast member’s assets are stored in an 
external file, and then sets the cast member’s pathName property to the location of a Flash movie 
on the World Wide Web: 

on startMovie 

member!new(#flash)).pathName = \ 

" http: //www. somellRL. com/my FI ash . swf" 
end

fi1eName (Member), linked 

pathStrength 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .model Resource! whichModelResource).\ 
emitter.pathStrength 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model resource whose type is #pa rti cl e, determines how closely 
the particles follow the path specified by the path property of the emitter. Its range starts at 0.0 
(no strength - so the particles won't be attracted to the path) and continues to infinity. Its default 
value is 0.1. Setting pathStrength to 0.0 is useful for turning the path off temporarily. 

As the value of pathStrength gets larger, the entire particle system will get more and more stiff. 
Large pathStrength values will tend to make the particles bounce around very quickly, unless 
some dampening force is also used, such as the particle drag property. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

In this example, ThermoSystem is a model resource of the type #particle. This statement sets the 
pathStrength property of ThermoSystem to 0.97. If a path is outlined by ThermoSystem’s 
emi tter. path property, the particles follow that path very closely. 

member!"Fires").model Resource!"ThermoSystem").emitter.\ 
pathStrength = 0.97

904 Chapter 14: Properties 




pattern 

Usage 

membert whichCastMember). pattern 
the pattern of member whichCastMember 

Description 

Cast member property; determines the pattern associated with the specified shape. Possible values 
are the numbers that correspond to the swatches in the Tools window’s patterns palette. If the 
shape cast member is unfilled, the pattern is applied to the cast member’s outer edge. 

This property can be useful in movies with Shockwave content to change images by changing the 
tiling applied to a shape, allowing you to save memory required by larger bitmaps. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

The following statements make the shape cast member Target Area a filled shape and assign it 
pattern 1, which is a solid color: 

membert"Target Area").filled = TRUE 
membert"Target Area").pattern = 1 

This handler cycles through eight tiles, with each tile’s number offset from the previous one, 
enabling you to create animation using smaller bitmaps: 

on exitFrame 

currentPat = membert"Background Shape").pattern 
nextPat = 57 + ((currentPat - 56) mod 8) 
membert"Background Shape").pattern = nextPat 
go the frame 
end 

pausedAtStart (Flash, Digital video) 

Usage 

membert whichFlashOrDigita1 VideoMember) .pausedAtStart 
the pausedAtStart of member whichFlashOrDigitalVideoMember 

Description 

Cast member property; controls whether the digital video or Flash movie plays when it appears on 
the Stage. If this property is TRU E, the digital video or Flash movie does not play when it appears. 
If this property is FALSE, it plays immediately when it appears. 

For a digital video cast member, the property specifies whether the Paused at Start check box in 
the Digital Video Cast Member Properties dialog box is selected or not. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement turns on the Paused at Start check box in the Digital Video Cast Member Info 
dialog box for the QuickTime movie Rotating Chair: 

membert"Rotating Chair").pausedAtStart = TRUE 


pausedAtStart (Flash, Digital video) 905 



pausedAtStart (RealMedia, Windows Media) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef .pausedAtStart 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. pausedAtStart; 

Description 

RealMedia and Windows Media sprite or cast member property; allows you to get or set whether 
a RealMedia or Windows Media stream on the Stage automatically begins to play when buffering 
is complete (FALSE or 0) or remains paused (TRUE or 1). Read/write. 

This property can be set to an expression that evaluates to TRUE or FALSE. Integer values other 
than 1 or 0 are treated as TRUE. The default setting for this property is FALSE. You can set this 
property to TRUE by selecting Paused in the graphical view of the Property inspector. 

If this property is set to FALSE, the user must click the Play button in the RealMedia or Windows 
Media viewer (or a button you have created for this purpose in your movie), or you must call the 
pi ay () method to play the sprite when buffering is complete. 

This property only affects score-based playback and does not affect playback in the RealMedia or 
Windows Media viewer. 

Example 

The following examples show that the pausedAtStart property of sprite 2 and the cast member 
Real is set to FALSE, which means that the RealMedia stream will automatically begin to play 
once buffering is complete. 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(2).pausedAtStart) -- 0 
put(member!"Real").pausedAtStart) -- 0 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(sprite(2).pausedAtStart); // 0 

put(member("Real").pausedAtStart); // 0 

The following examples set the pausedAtStart property for sprite 2 and the cast member Real 
to TRUE, which means the RealMedia stream will not begin to play unless the pi ay command 
is called. 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(2).pausedAtStart = TRUE 
member("Real").pausedAtStart = TRUE 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(2).pausedAtStart = 1; 

member("Real").pausedAtStart = 1; 


906 Chapter 14: Properties 



The following example uses the pausedAtStart property to buffer a RealMedia sprite off the 
Stage, and then play it on the Stage once the buffering is complete. In this example, the 
RealMedia member has its pausedAtStart property set to TRUE. An instance of this member is 
positioned off the Stage, in sprite channel 1. The following frame script should be placed in the 
sprite span: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame me 

if sprite(l).state > 3 then -- check to see if buffering is complete 
sprite(1).1ocH =162 
sprite(1).1ocV = 118 

sprite(1).piay() -- position and play the sprite 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFrame!) { 

var st = sprite(1).state; 

if (st > 3) { // check to see if buffering is complete 
sprite(1).1ocH = 162; 
sprite(1).1ocV = 118; 

sprite(1).piay(); // position and play the sprite 

1 


The RealMedia sprite will buffer off the Stage and then appear on the Stage and play immediately 
when the buffering is complete. 

percentBuffered 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef .percentBuffered 

// JavaScript syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. percentBuffered; 

Description 

RealMedia sprite or cast member property; returns the percentage of the buffer that has been 
filled with the RealMedia stream that is loading from a local file or the server. When this property 
reaches 100, the buffer is full, and the RealMedia stream begins to play if the pausedAtStart 
property is not set to TRUE. This property is dynamic during playback and cannot be set. 

The buffer is a type of memory cache that contains the portion of the movie that is about to play, 
usually just a few seconds. The stream enters the buffer as it streams to RealPlayer and leaves the 
buffer as RealPlayer plays the clip. The buffer allows viewers to view content without 
downloading the entire file, and prevents network congestion or lapses in bandwidth availability 
from disrupting the playback stream. 

The buffering process is initiated by the pi ay command, and once the buffer is full (100%), the 
portion of the stream that is in the buffer begins to play. Because the initial buffering process takes 
a few seconds, there is a delay between the time when the pi ay command is called and when the 
stream actually begins to play. You can workaround this using the pausedAtStart command, 
starting to play the stream off the Stage during the buffering process, and then displaying the 
stream on the Stage as it actually begins to play. (For more information, see the example in the 
pausedAtStart (RealMedia, Windows Medi a ) on page 906 entry.) 


percentBuffered 907 



Example 

The following examples show that 56% of the RealMedia stream in sprite 2 and the cast member 
Real has been buffered. 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(2).percentBuffered) -- 56 
put(member("Real").percentBuffered) -- 56 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(sprite(2).percentBuffered); // 56 

put(member("Real").percentBuffered); // 56

percentPlayed 

Usage 

member( whichCastMember) .percentPlayed 
the percentPlayed of member whichCastMember 

Description 

Shockwave Audio (SWA) cast member property; returns the percentage of the specified SWA file 
that has actually played. 

This property can be tested only after the SWA sound starts playing or has been preloaded by 
means of the preLoadBuffer command. This property cannot be set. 

Example 

This handler displays the percentage of the SWA streaming cast member Frank Sinatra that has 
played and puts the value in the field cast member Percent Played: 

on exitFrame 

whatState = member("Frank Sinatra").state 
if whatState > 1 AND whatState < 9 then 
member("Percent PIayed") .text = / 
string(member("Frank Sinatra").percent PIayed) 
end i f 
end

percentStreamed (Member) 

percentStreamed (3D) 

Usage 

member( whichCastMember) .percentStreamed 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get the percentage of a 3D cast member that has been streamed. This 
property refers to either the initial file import or to the last file load requested. The value returned 
is an integer and has a range from 0 to 100. There is no default value for this property. 


908 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 


This statement shows that the cast member PartyScene has finished loading. 

put member("PartyScene").percentStreamed 
-- 100 

percentStreamed (Member) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. percentStreamed 

// JavaScript syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. percentStreamed; 

Description 

Shockwave Audio (SWA) and Flash cast member property, and QuickTime sprite property. 

For SWA streaming sounds, gets the percent of a SWA file already streamed from an PITTP or 
FTP server. For SWA, this property differs from the percentPi ayed property in that it includes 
the amount of the file that has been buffered but not yet played. This property can be tested only 
after the SWA sound starts playing or has been preloaded by means of the preLoadBuffer 
command. 

For Flash movie cast members, this property gets the percent of a Flash movie that has streamed 
into memory. 

For QuickTime sprites, this property gets the percent of the QuickTime file that has played. 

This property can have a value from 0 to 100%. For a file on a local disk, the value is 100. For 
files being streamed from the Internet, the percentStreamed value increases as more bytes are 
received. This property cannot be set. 

Example 

This example displays the percentage of the SWA streaming cast member Ray Charles that has 
streamed and puts the value in a field: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame 

whatState = memberC'Ray Chari es"). state 
if whatState > 1 AND whatState < 9 then 

member("Percent Streamed Displayer").text = \ 
string(member("Ray Charles").percentStreamed) 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFrame!) { 

var whatState = memberC'Ray Chari es"). state ; 

var pcStm = new String(member("Ray Charies").percentStreamed); 

if (whatState > 1 && whatState < 9) { 

member("Percent Streamed Displayer").text = pcStm; 

1

percentStreamed (Member) 909 



This frame script keeps the playhead looping in the current frame so long as less than 60 percent 
of a Flash movie called Splash Screen has streamed into memory: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame 

if member!"Splash Screen").percentStreamed < 60 then 
_movie.go(_movie.frame) 
end i f 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function exitFrame!) { 

var ssStrm = member!"Splash Screen").percentStreamed; 
if (ssStrm < 60) { 

_movie.go(_movie.frame);

period 

Usage 

timeoutObject. period 

Description 

Object property; the number of milliseconds between timeout events sent by the timeoutObject 
to the timeout handler. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This timeout handler decreases the timeout’s peri od by one second each time it’s invoked, until a 
minimum period of 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds) is reached: 

on hand!eTimeout timeoutObject 

if timeoutObject.period > 2000 then 

timeoutObject.period = timeoutObject.period - 1000 
end i f 

end handleTimeout

persistent 

Usage 

timeoutObject. persistent 

Description 

Object property; determines whether the given timeoutObject is removed from the 
ti meoutLi st when the current movie stops playing. If TRUE, timeoutObject remains active. If 
FALSE, the timeout object is deleted when the movie stops playing. The default value is FALSE. 


910 Chapter 14: Properties 




Setting this property to TRUE allows a timeout object to continue generating timeout events in 
other movies. This is useful when one movie branches to another with the go to movi e 
command. 

Example 

This prepareMovie handler creates a timeout object that will remain active after the declaring 
movie stops playing: 

on prepareMovie 

-- Make a timeout object that sends an event every 60 minutes, 
timeout("reminder").new(1000 * 60 * 60, #handleReminder) 
timeoutt"reminder").persistent = TRUE 
end

picture (Member) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. pi cture 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. pi cture; 

Description 

Cast member property; determines which image is associated with a bitmap, text, or PICT cast 
member. To update changes to a cast member’s registration point or update changes to an image 
after relinking it using the f i 1 eName property, use the following statement: 

member( whichCastMember) .picture = member( whichCastMember ).picture 

where you replace wh i chCastMember with the name or number of the affected cast member. 

Because changes to cast members are stored in RAM, this property is best used during authoring. 
Avoid setting it in projectors. 

The property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable named pictHolder to the image in the cast member 
named Sunset: 

-- Lingo syntax 

pictHolder = member("Sunset").picture 
// JavaScript syntax 

var pictHolder = member("Sunset").picture;

picture (Member) 911 



picture (Window) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
windowObjRef .pi cture 

// JavaScript syntax 
windowObjRef. picture; 

Description 

Window property; provides a way to get a picture of the current contents of a window—either the 
Stage window or a movie in a window (MIAW). Read-only. 

You can apply the resulting bitmap data to an existing bitmap or use it to create a new one. 

If no picture exists, this property returns VOID (Lingo) or nul 1 (JavaScript syntax). 

Example 

This statement grabs the current content of the Stage and places it into a bitmap cast member: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"Stage image").picture = _movie.stage.picture 
// JavaScript syntax 

member!"Stage image").picture = _movie.stage.picture;

Windows 95 or Windows NT 


For forward compatibility and to allow for addition of values, it is better to test the platform by 
using contai ns. 


912 Chapter 14: Properties 










Example 


This statement checks whether a projector was created for Windows 95 or Windows NT: 
on exitFrame 

if the platform contains "Windows,32" then 
castLib("Win95 Art").name = "Interface" 
end i f 
end

playlist 

Usage 

member ( whi chCastmember) .model (whi chModel ). keyframe PI ayer. pi ayl i st 
member! whichCastmember) .model (whichModel ).bonesPl ayer.pl ay list 

Description 

3D #key frame PI ayer and #bonesPl ayer modifier property; returns a linear list of property lists, 
each representing a motion queued for playback by the modifier. 

Each property list will have the following properties: 

• #name is the name of the motion to be played. 

• #1 oop indicates whether the motions playback should be looped. 

• #sta rtTi me is the time, in milliseconds at which playback of the animation should begin. 

• #endTi me is the time, in milliseconds at which playback of the animation ends or when 
the motion should be looped. A negative value indicates that the motion should be played 
to the end. 

• #s ca 1 e is rate of play for the motion that is to be multiplied by the modifier’s playRate 
property to determine the actual speed of the motion’s playback. 

The pi ayl i st property can be tested but not set. Use the queue!), play!), playNext!), and 
removeLast!) commands to manipulate it. 

Example 

The following statement displays the currently queued motions for the model Stroller in the 
Message window. There are two currently queued motions: Walk and Jump. 

put member!"ParkScene").model("Stroller").bonesPlayer.pl ay List 
-- [[#name: "Walk", #loop: 1, #startTime: 1500, #endTime: 16000, \ 

#scal e:1.0000, #offset: 0], [#name: "Jump", #loop: 1, \

playRate (3D) 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .model (whichModel) .bonesPl ayer.pi ayRate 
member! whichCastmember) .model (whichModel) .keyframe PI ayer.pi ayRate 

Description 

3D #keyframePl ayer and #bonesPl ayer modifier property; scale multiplier for the local time 
of motions being played. This property only partially determines the speed at which motions are 
executed by the model. 

The playback of a motion by a model is the result of either aplay!) or queue!) command. The 
seal e parameter of the pi ay () or queue! ) command is multiplied by the modifier’s pi ay Rate 
property, and the resulting value is the speed at which the particular motion will be played back. 


playRate (3D) 915 



Example 

This statement sets the pi ayRate property of the keyf ramePl ayer modifier for the model 
named GreenAlien to 3: 

member("newAliens").model("GreenA1ien").keyframePlayer.piayRate = 3

playRate (QuickTime, AVI) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spri teObjRef. pi ayRate 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. pi ayRate; 

Description 

Digital video sprite property; controls the rate at which a digital video in a specific channel plays. 
The movie rate is a value specifying the playback of the digital video. A value of 1 specifies normal 
forward play, -1 specifies reverse, and 0 specifies stop. Higher and lower values are possible. For 
example, a value of 0.5 causes the digital video to play slower than normal. However, frames may 
be dropped when the pi ay Rate sprite property exceeds 1. The severity of frame dropping 
depends on factors such as the performance of the computer the movie is playing on and whether 
the digital video sprite is stretched. 

This property can be tested and set. 


916 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 

This statement sets the rate for a digital video in sprite channel 9 to normal playback speed: 

-- Lingo syntax 
sprite(9).piayRate = 1 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(9).pi ay Rate = 1; 

This statement causes the digital video in sprite channel 9 to play in reverse: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(9).pi ay Rate = -1 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(9).piayRate = -1;

pointAtOrientation 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel ).poi ntAtOri entati on 
member! whichCastmember). group! whichGroup) .poi ntAtOri entati on 
member! whichCastmember). 1 i ght! whichLight). poi ntAtOri entati on 
member! whichCastmember) .camera( whichCamera) .pointAtOrientation 

Description 

3D model, light, group and camera property; allows you to get or set how the referenced object 
responds to the poi ntAt command. This property is a linear list of two object-relative vectors, the 
first vector in the list defines which direction is considered the objects front direction, the second 
defines which direction is considered the objects up direction. 

The object’s front and up directions do not need to be perpendicular to each other, but they 
should not be parallel to each other. 

Example 

This statement displays the object-relative front direction and up direction vectors of the model 
named bipOl: 

put member!"scene").model("bipOl").poi ntAtOri entati on 
-- [vector(0.0000, 0.0000, 1.0000), vector(0.0000, 1.0000, 0.0000)]

pointAt 

pointOfContact 

Usage 

col 1isi onData.pointOfContact 

Description 

3D colli si onData property; returns a vector describing the point of contact in a collision 
between two models. 

The col 1 i si onData object is sent as an argument with the #col 1 i deWi th and #col 1 i deAny 
events to the handler specified in the regi sterForEvent, regi sterScri pt, and 
setCol 1 i si onCal 1 back commands. 

The #col 1 i deWi th and #col 1 i deAny events are sent when a collision occurs between models to 
which collision modifiers have been added. The resol ve property of the models’ modifiers must 
be set to TRUE. 

This property can be tested but not set. 


918 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 


This example has two parts. The first part is the first line of code, which registers the #expl ode 
handler for the #col 1 i deAny event. The second part is the #expl ode handler. When two models 
in the cast member MyScene collide, the #expl ode handler is called and the col 1 i si onData 
argument is sent to it. The first nine lines of the #expl ode handler create the model resource 
named SparkSource and set its properties. This model resource is a single burst of particles. The 
tenth line of the handler creates a model named SparksModel using the model resource named 
SparkSource. The last line of the handler sets the position of SparksModel to the position where 
the collision occurred. The overall effect is a burst of sparks caused by a collision. 

member("MyScene").registerForEvent(#col1ideAny, #explode, 0) 
on explode me, col 1isionData 

nmr = member!"MyScene").newModel Resource! "SparkSource”, #particle) 

nmr.emitter.mode = #burst 

nmr.emitter.1oop = 0 

nmr.emitter.minSpeed = 30 

nmr.emitter.maxSpeed = 50 

nmr.emitter.directi on = vector(0, 0, 1) 

nmr.colorRange.start = rgb(0, 0, 255) 

nmr.colorRange.end = rgb(255, 0, 0) 

nmr.1ifetime = 5000 

nm = member!"MyScene").newModel("SparksModel”, nmr) 
nm.transform.position = collisionData.pointOfContact

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .node! whichNode) .transform.posi ti on 
member! whichCastmember) .node! whichNode ).getWorl dTransform!).\ 
position 

transform, posi ti on 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set the positional component of a transform. A transform 
defines a scale, position and rotation within a given frame of reference. The default value of this 
property is vector (0,0,0). 

A node can be a camera, group, light or model object. Setting the posi ti on of a node’s 
transform defines that objects position within the transform’s frame of reference. Setting the 
position property of an object’s world relative transform using getWorl dT ransform!). posi ti on 
defines the object’s position relative to the world origin. Setting the position property of an 
object’s parent relative transform using transform. posi ti on defines the object’s position relative 
to its parent node. 

The worl dPosi ti on property of a model, light, camera or group object is a shortcut to the 
getWorl dTransform!). posi ti on version of this property for that object. 


position (transform) 919 





Example 

The following statement displays the parent-relative position of the model named Tire. 

put member("scene").model("Tire").transform.position 
-- vector(-15.000, -2.5000, 20.0000) 

The following statement displays the world-relative position of the model named Tire. 

put member!"scene").model("Tire").getWorldTransform!).position 
-- vector!5.0000, -2.5000, -10.0000) 

The following statements first store the world transform of the model named Tire in the variable 
tempT ransform, then they display the position component of that transform. 

tempT ransform = member!"scene").model("Tire").getWorldTransform!) 
put tempTransform.position 
-- vector!5.0000, -2.5000, -10.0000)

positionReset 

Description 

3D keyf ramePl ayer and bonesPl ayer modifier property; indicates whether the model returns 
to its starting position after the end of a motion (TRUE) or not (FALSE). 

The default value for this property is TRUE. 

Example 

This statement prevents the model Monster from returning to its original position when it 
finishes the execution of a motion: 

member!"NewAlien").model("Monster").keyframePlayer.\ 
positionReset = FALSE

posterFrame 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef .posterFrame 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. posterFrame; 

Description 

Flash cast member property; controls which frame of a Flash movie cast member is used for its 
thumbnail image. This property specifies an integer corresponding to a frame number in the 
Flash movie. 

This property can be tested and set. The default value is 1. 

Example 

This handler accepts a reference to a Flash movie cast member and a frame number as parameters, 
and it then sets the thumbnail of the specified movie to the specified frame number: 

-- Lingo syntax 

on resetThumbnai1(whichFlashMovie, whichFrame) 
memberlwhichFlashMovie).posterFrame = whichFrame 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function resetThumbnai1(whichFlashMovie, whichFrame) { 
memberlwhichFlashMovie).posterFrame = whichFrame; 

1 


preferred3dRenderer 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.preferred3dRenderer 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.preferred3dRenderer; 

Description 

Movie property; allows you to get or set the default Tenderer used to draw 3D sprites within a 
particular movie if that Tenderer is available on the client machine. Read/write. 

If the specified Tenderer is not available on the client machine, the movie selects the most suitable 
available Tenderer. 

The possible values for this property are as follows: 

• #openGL specifies the openGL drivers for a hardware acceleration that work with both 
Macintosh and Windows platforms. 

• #di rectX7_0 specifies the DirectX 7 drivers for hardware acceleration that work only with 
Windows platforms. 

• #di rectX5_2 specifies the DirectX 5.2 drivers for hardware acceleration that work only with 
Windows platforms. 


preferred3dRenderer 921 



• #sof twa re specifies the Director built-in software Tenderer that works with both Macintosh 
and Windows platforms. 

• #a uto specifies that the most suitable Tenderer should be chosen. This is the default value for 
this property. 

The value set for this property is used as the default for the Renderer Services object’s 
Tenderer property. 

This property differs from the getRendererServices() object’s renderer property in that the 
preferred3dRenderer specifies the preferred renderer to use, whereas the 
getRendererServi ces ( ) object’s renderer property indicates what renderer is actually being 
used by the movie. 

Shockwave Player users have the option of specifying the renderer of their choice using the 3D 
Renderer context menu in Shockwave Player. If the user selects the “Obey content settings” 
option, the renderer specified by the renderer or preferred3DRenderer property is used to 
draw the movie (if available on the user’s system), otherwise, the renderer selected by the user 
is used. 

Example 

This statement allows the movie to pick the best 3D renderer available on the user’s system: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.preferred3dRenderer = #auto 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.preferred3dRenderer = "auto";

preLoad (3D) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .prel oad 
memberReference. prel oad 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set whether data is preloaded before playing (TRUE), or is 
streamed while playing (FALSE). This property can be used only with linked files. The default 
value is FALSE. 

In Director, setting the preLoad property to TRUE causes the cast member to load completely 
before playback starts. In Shockwave Player, setting the preLoad property to TRUE causes the cast 
member to begin streaming when the movie starts playing. Before perfoming any Lingo 
operations on a 3D cast member that is streaming, be sure to check that the cast member’s state 
property has a value greater than or equal to 2. 

Example 

This statement sets the prel oad property of the cast member PartyScene to FALSE, which allows 
externally linked media to stream into PartyScene during playback: 

ember("PartyScene").prel oad = FALSE 
member("3D world").preload

state (3D) 

preLoad (Member) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. preLoad 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. preLoad; 

Description 

Cast member property; determines whether the digital video cast member specified by 
wh 7 chCastMember can be preloaded into memory (TRUE) or not (FALSE , default). The TRUE 
status has the same effect as selecting Enable Preload in the Digital Video Cast Member 
Properties dialog box. 

For Flash movie cast members, this property controls whether a Flash movie must load entirely 
into RAM before the first frame of a sprite is displayed (TRUE), or whether the movie can stream 
into memory as it plays (FALSE, default). This property works only for linked Flash movies whose 
assets are stored in an external file; it has no effect on members whose assets are stored in the cast. 
The streamMode and buf ferSi ze properties determine how the cast member is streamed into 
memory. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement reports in the Message window whether the QuickTime movie Rotating Chair can 
be preloaded into memory: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(member("Rotating Chair").preload) 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(member("Rotating Chair").preload); 

See also 

bufferSize, streamMode 

preLoadEventAbort 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.preLoadEventAbort 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.preLoadEventAbort; 

Description 

Movie property; specifies whether pressing keys or clicking the mouse can stop the preloading of 
cast members (TRUE) or not (FALSE, default). Read/write. 

Setting this property affects the current movie. 


preLoadEventAbort 923 



Example 

This statement lets the user stop the preloading of cast members by pressing keys or clicking the 
mouse button: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.preLoadEventAbort = TRUE 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.preLoadEventAbort = true; 

See also 

Movi e 

preLoadMode 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
castObjRef. preLoadMode 

// JavaScript syntax 
castObjRef. preLoadMode; 

Description 

Cast library property; determines the preload mode of a specified cast library. Read/write. 

Valid values of preLoadMode are: 

• 0. Load the cast library when needed. This is the default value. 

• 1. Load the cast library before frame 1. 

• 2. Load the cast library after frame 1. 

Setting this property has the same effect as setting Load Cast in the Cast Properties dialog box. 

Example 

The following statement tells Director to load the members of the cast named Buttons before the 
movie enters frame 1: 

-- Lingo syntax 

castLib("Buttons").preLoadMode = 1 

// JavaScript syntax 

cast Lib("Buttons").preLoadMode = 1;

924 Chapter 14: Properties 



preLoadRAM 

Usage 

the preLoadRAM 

Description 

System property; specifies the amount of RAM that can be used for preloading a digital video. 
This property can be set and tested. 

This property is useful for managing memory, limiting digital video cast members to a certain 
amount of memory, so that other types of cast members can still be preloaded. When 
preLoadRAM is FALSE, all available memory can be used for preloading digital video cast 
members. 

However, it’s not possible to reliably predict how much RAM a digital video will require once it is 
preloaded, because memory requirements are affected by the content of the movie, how much 
compression was performed, the number of keyframes, changing imagery, and so on. 

It is usually safe to preload the first couple of seconds of a video and then continue streaming 
from that point on. 

If you know the data rate of your movie, you can estimate the setting for preLoadRAM. For 
example, if your movie has a data rate of 300K per second, set preLoadRAM to 600K if you 
want to preload the first 2 seconds of the video file. This is only an estimate, but it works in 
most situations. 

Example 

This statement sets preLoadRAM to 600K, to preload the first 2 seconds of a movie with a data 
rate of 300K per second: 

set the preLoadRAM = 600

preLoadTime 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef .preLoadT i me 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. preLoadTime; 

Description 

Cast member and sound channel property; for cast members, specifies the amount of the 
Shockwave Audio (SWA) streaming cast member to download, in seconds, before playback begins 
or when a preLoadBuffer command is used. The default value is 5 seconds. 

This property can be set only when the SWA streaming cast member is stopped. 

For sound channels, the value is for the given sound in the queue or the currently playing sound if 
none is specified. 


preLoadTime 925 



Example 

The following handler sets the preload download time for the SWA streaming cast member Louis 
Armstrong to 6 seconds. The actual preload occurs when a preLoadBuf fer or pi ay command 
is issued. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown 

member("Louis Armstrong").stop() 
membert"Loui s Armstrong").preLoadTime = 6 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDownO { 

membert"Louis Armstrong").stop(); 
membert"Loui s Armstrong").preLoadTime = 6; 

1 

This statement returns the preLoadTime of the currently playing sound in sound channel 1: 

-- Lingo syntax

projection 

Usage 

sprite( whichSprite). camera.project ion 
camera ( whichCamera). project;' on 

member( whichCastmember) .camera( whichCamera) .projection 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set the projection style of the camera. Possible values are 
#perspecti ve (the default) and #orthographi c. 

When projection is #perspecti ve, objects closer to the camera appear larger than objects farther 
from the camera, and the projectionAngle or fieldOfView properties specify the vertical 
projection angle (which determines how much of the world you see). The horizontal projection 
angle is determined by the aspect ratio of the camera's rect property. 


projection 927 



When projection is #orthographi c, the apparent size of objects does not depend on distance 
from the camera, and the orthoHeight property specifies how many world units fit vertically 
into the sprite (which determines how much of the world you see). The orthographic projection 
width is determined by the aspect ratio of the camera's rect property. 

Example 

This statement sets the projection property of the camera of sprite 5 to ((orthographic: 
sprite(5).camera .project!on = ((orthographic

purgePriority 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. purgePri ori ty 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. purgePri ori ty; 

Description 

Member property; specifies the purge priority of a cast member. Read/write. 

A cast member’s purge priorities determine the priority that Director follows to choose which cast 
members to delete from memory when memory is full. The higher the purge priority, the more 
likely that the cast member will be deleted. The following purgePri ori ty settings are available: 

• 0—Never 

• 1—Last 

• 2—Next 

• 3—Normal (default) 

The Normal setting lets Director purge cast members from memory at random. The Next, Last, 
and Never settings allow some control over purging, but Last or Never may cause your movie to 
run out of memory if several cast members are set to these values. 

Setting purgePri ori ty for cast members is useful for managing memory when the size of the 
movie’s cast library exceeds the available memory. As a general rule, you can minimize pauses 
while the movie loads cast members and reduce the number of times Director reloads a cast 
member by assigning a low purge priority to cast members that are used frequently in the course 
of the movie. 

Example 

This statement sets the purge priority of cast member Background to 3, which makes it one of the 
first cast members to be purged when memory is needed: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("Background").purgePriority = 3 
// JavaScript syntax 

member("Background").purgePriority = 3;

quad 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spri teObjRef. quad 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. quad; 

Description 

Sprite property; contains a list of four points, which are floating point values that describe the 
corner points of a sprite on the Stage. Read/write. 

The points of the quad are organized in the following order: upper left, upper right, lower right, 
and lower left. 

The points themselves can be manipulated to create perspective and other image distortions. 

After you manipulate the quad of a sprite, you can reset it to the Score values by turning off the 
scripted sprite with puppetSprite( intSpri teNum, FALSE ). When the quad of a sprite is 
disabled, you cannot rotate or skew the sprite. 

Example 

This statement displays a typical list describing a sprite: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(sprited) .quad) 

// JavaScript syntax 
putCsprite(l).quad); 

When modifying the quad sprite property, you must reset the list of points after changing any of 
the values. This is because when you set a variable to the value of a property, you are placing a 
copy of the list, not the list itself, in the variable. To effect a change, use syntax like this (applies to 
Lingo only): 

-- Lingo syntax 
currQuadList = sprite(5).quad 

currQuadListC1] = currQuadList[l] + point(50, 50) 
sprit e(5).quad = currQuadList

quality 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. qual i ty 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. qual i ty ; 

Description 

Flash cast member and sprite property; controls whether Director uses anti-aliasing to render a 
Flash movie sprite, producing high-quality rendering but possibly slower movie playback. The 
qual i ty property can have these values: 

• #autoHi gh —Director starts by rendering the sprite with anti-aliasing. If the actual frame rate 
falls below the movie’s specified frame rate, Director turns off anti-aliasing. This setting gives 
precedence to playback speed over visual quality. 

• #autoLow—Director starts by rendering the movie without anti-aliasing. If the Flash player 
determines that the computer processor can handle it, anti-aliasing is turned on. This setting 
gives precedence to visual quality whenever possible. 

• #high (default)—The movie always plays with anti-aliasing. 

• #1 ow —The movie always plays without anti-aliasing. 

The quality property can be tested and set. 

Example 

The following sprite script checks the color depth of the computer on which the movie is playing. 
If the color depth is set to 8 bits or less (256 colors), the script sets the quality of the sprite in 
channel 5 to #1 ow. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on beginSprite me 

if _system.col orDepth <= 8 then 
sprite(1).quality = #low 
end i f

[shaderListIndex] . texture! whichTexture) .quality 
member! whichCastmember ).model! whichModel ). shaderList\ 

[ shaderListlndex ]. texturelist[ TextureListlndex ].quality 

Description 

3D texture property; lets you get or set the image quality of a texture by controlling the level of 
mipmapping applied to the texture. Mipmapping is a process by which additional versions of the 
texture image are created in several sizes that are smaller than the original image. The 3D Xtra 
extension then uses whichever version of the image is most appropriate to the current size of the 
model on the screen and changes the version of the image that is being used when needed. 
Trilinear mipmapping is higher in quality and uses more memory than bilinear mipmapping. 

Mipmapping is not the same as filtering, although both improve texture appearance. Filtering 
spreads errors out across the texture’s area so that errors are less concentrated. Mipmapping 
resamples the image to make it the appropriate size. 

This property can have the following values: 

• #1 ow is the same as off, and mipmapping is not used for the texture. 

• #medi urn enables a low-quality (bilinear) mipmapping for the texture. 

• #hi gh enables a high-quality (trilinear) mipmapping for the texture. 

The default is #1 ow. 

Example 

This statement sets the quality property of the texture Marsmap to #medi um: 
member("scene").texture!"Marsmap").quality = (/medium

radius 

Usage 

modelResourceObjectReference . radi us 

member! whichCastmember) .model Resource! whichModelResource) .radius 

Description 

3D model property; when used with model resource of type (/sphere or #cyl i nder, allows you 
to get or set the radius of the model. 

The radius property determines the sweep radius used to generate the model resource. This 
property’s value must always be set to greater than 0.0, and has a default value of 25.0. 


radius 931 



Example 

This example shows that the radius of the model resource SphereOl is 24.0: 

put member("3D World").model Resource!"SphereOl").radius 
-- 24.0 

randomSeed 

Usage 

the randomSeed 

Description 

System property; specifies the seed value used for generating random numbers accessed through 
the random! ) function. 

Using the same seed produces the same sequence of random numbers. This property can be useful 
for debugging during development. Using the ticks property is an easy way to produce a unique 
random seed since the ticks value is highly unlikely to be duplicated on subsequent uses. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement displays the random seed number in the Message window:

recordFont 

Usage 

recordFontiwhichCastMember, font {[.face]) { ,lbitmapSizesl] {,characterSubset] 
{, userFontName ]) 

Description 

Command; embeds a TrueType or Type 1 font as a cast member. Once embedded, these fonts are 
available to the author just like other fonts installed in the system. 

You must create an empty font cast member with the new! ) command before using recordFont. 

• font —Name of original font to be recorded. 

• face —List of symbols indicating the face of the original font; possible values are #pl a i n, 

#bol d, #i tal i c. If you do not provide a value for this argument, #pl ain is used. 

• bi tmapSizes —List of integers specifying the sizes for which bitmaps are to be recorded. This 
argument can be empty. If you omit this argument, no bitmaps are generated. These bitmaps 
typically look better at smaller point sizes (below 14 points) but take up more memory. 

• characterSubset —String of characters to be encoded. Only the specified characters will be 
available in the font. If this argument is, all characters are encoded. If only certain characters 
are encoded but an unencoded character is used, that character is displayed as an empty box. 

• userFontName —A string to use as the name of the newly recorded font cast member. 


932 Chapter 14: Properties 



The command creates a Shock Font in whichCastMember using the font named in the font 
argument. The value returned from the command reports whether the operation was successful. 
Zero indicates success. 

Example 

This statement creates a simple Shock Font using only the two arguments for the cast member 
and the font to record: 

myNewFontMember = new(#font) 
recordFont(myNewFontMember, "Lunar Lander") 

This statement specifies the bitmap sizes to be generated and the characters for which the font 
data should be created: 

myNewFontMember = new(#font) 

recordfont(mynewmember,"1unar lander", [], [14, 18, 45], "Lunar Lander Game 

High \ Score First Last Name") 

Note: Since recordFont resynthesizes the font data rather than using it directly, there are no legal 
restrictions on Shock Font distribution.

rect (camera) 

Usage 

sprite! whichSprite). camera ( whichCamera) .rect 

Description 

3D camera property; allows you to get or set the rectangle that controls the size and position 
of the camera. This rectangle is analogous to the rectangle you see through the eyepiece of a 
real camera. 

The default value for the rect property for all cameras rect(0,0,1,1) which makes them invisible 
until you change the setting. However, when sprite.came rad) is rendered, its rect is reset to 
rect(0, 0, spriteiwhichSprite) .width, sprite( whichSprite) . hei ght ) so that the 
camera fills the screen. All camera rect coordinates are given relative to the top left corner of 
the sprite. 

If whi chCamera is greater than 1, the rect is not scaled when the sprite is scaled, so it will be 
necessary to manage that with script if desired. 

When wh ichCamera is greater than 1, the rect. top and rect. 1 eft properties must be greater 
than or equal to the rect. top and rect. 1 eft settings for sprite.came rad). 

Example 

This statement sets the rect of the default camera of sprite 5 to rect(0, 0, 200, 550): 
sprite(5).camera.rect = rect(0, 0, 200, 550)

rect (Image) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
imageObjRef . rect 

// JavaScript syntax

Description 

Image property. Returns a rectangle describing the size of a given image. Read-only. 

The returned rectangle coordinates are given relative to the top left corner of the image. 
Therefore, the left and top values of the rectangle are 0, and the right and bottom values are the 
width and height of the cast member. 

Example 

This statement returns the rectangle of the 300 x 400 pixel member Sunrise in the 
message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"Sunrise").image.rect -- rect(0, 0, 300, 400) 

// JavaScript syntax 

member!"Sunrise").image.rect; // rect(0, 0, 300, 400) 

This Lingo looks at the first 50 cast members and displays the rectangle and name of each cast 
member that is a bitmap:

rect (Member) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. rect 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. rect; 

Description 

Member property; specifies the left, top, right, and bottom coordinates, returned as a rectangle, 
for the rectangle of any graphic cast member, such as a bitmap, shape, movie, or digital video. 
Read-only for all cast members, read/write for field cast members only. 

For a bitmap, the rect property is measured from the upper left corner of the bitmap, instead of 
from the upper left corner of the easel in the Paint window. 

For an Xtra extension cast member, the rect property is a rectangle whose upper left corner is 
at (0,0). 

Example 

This statement displays the coordinates of bitmap cast member 20: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(member(20).rect) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(member(20).rect); 

This statement sets the coordinates of bitmap cast member Banner: 

-- Lingo syntax

rect (Window) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
windowObjRef. rect 

// JavaScript syntax 
windowObjRef. rect; 

Description 

Window property; specifies the left, top, right, and bottom coordinates, as a rectangle, of a 
window. Read/write. 

If the size of the rectangle specified is less than that of the Stage where the movie was created, the 
movie is cropped in the window, not resized. 

To pan or scale the movie playing in the window, set the draw Rect or source Rect property of 
the window. 

Example 

This statement displays the coordinates of the window named Control_panel: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(windowt"Control_panel").rect) 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(windowt"Control_panel").rect); 

See also 

drawRect, sourceRect, Window 


ref 

Usage 

chunkExpression.re f 

Description 

Text chunk expression property; this provides a convenient way to refer to a chunk expression 
within a text cast member. 


936 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 


Without references, you would need statements like these: 

member ( whichTextMember). 1 i ne[ whichLine~\. word[ firstlford. . 1 astblord] .font = 

"Palatino" 

member! whi chTextMember). 1 i ne[ whichL in el . word[ fi rstlford. . 1 astHordl . fontSi ze = 
36 

member! whi chTextMember). 1 i ne[ whichL i ne]. word[ fi rstklord. . 1 astblord ]. font Sty 1 e = 
[#bold] 

But with a ref property, you can refer to the same chunk as follows: 

my Ref = member! whi chTextMember). 1 i ne[ whi chLi ne~i. word[ fi rstWord. . 1 astUord] .ref 

The variable my Ref is now shorthand for the entire chunk expression. This allows something like 
the following: 

put myRef.font 
-- "Palatino" 

Or you can set a property of the chunk as follows: 

myRef.fontSize = 18 

myRef.fontStyle = C#ita1ic] 

You can get access to the string referred to by the reference using the text property of 
the reference: 

put myRef.text 

This would result in the actual string data, not information about the string. 

reflectionMap 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember). shader! whichShader ).reflectionMap 

Description 

3D shader property; allows you to get and set the texture used to create reflections on the surface 
of a model. This texture is applied to the third texture layer of the shader. This property is ignored 
if the toon modifier is applied to the model resource. 

This helper property provides a simple interface for setting up a common use of reflection 
mapping. The same effect can be achieved by setting the following properties: 

shader.textureModeList[3] = #reflection 
shader.blendFunctionLis t C 3] = #blend 
shader.blendSourceList[3] = #constant 
shader.blendConstantLis t C 3] = 50.0 

When tested, this property returns the texture associated with the model’s third texture layer. The 
default is void. 

Example 

This statement causes the model named GlassSphere to appear to reflect the texture named 
Portrait off of its surface: 

member!"3DPlanet").model("Glass Sphere").shader.reflectionMap = \ 
member!"3DPI a net").texture!"Portrait”) 


reflectionMap 937 



See also 

textureModeList , blendFunctionList , blendConstantList 

reflectivity 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).refl ecti vi ty 

Description 

3D shader property; allows you to get or set the shininess of the referenced members default 
shader. The value is a floating point value representing the percentage of light to be reflected off 
the surface of a model using the default shader, from 0.0 to 100.00. The default value is 0.0. 

Example 

This statement sets the shininess of the default shader in the cast member named Scene to 50%: 

member!"Scene").reflectivity = 50 

region 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource! whichModelResource).\ 
emitter.region 

model ResourceObjectReference .emi tter.region 

Description 

3D emitter property; when used with a model resource whose type is #pa rti cl e, allows you to 
both get and set the regi on property of the resource’s particle emitter. 

The region property defines the location from which particles are emitted. If its value is a 
single vector, then that vector is used to define a point in the 3D world from which particles 
will be emitted. 

If its value is a list of two vectors, then those vectors are used to define the end points of a line 
segment from which particles will be emitted. 

If its value is a list of four vectors, then those vectors are used to define the vertices of a 
quadrilateral from which the particles will be emitted. 

The default value for this property is [vector(0,0,0)]. 

Example 

In this example, ThermoSystem is a model resource of the type #particle. This statement specifies 
the four corners of a rectangle from which the particles of ThermoSystem originate. 

member!"Fires").model Resource!"ThermoSystem").emitter.region = \ 

[vector(20,90,100), vector(30,90,100), vector(30,100,100), \ 
vector(20,100,100) ]

regPoint 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. regPoi nt 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. regPoi nt ; 

Description 

Member property; specifies the registration point of a cast member. Read/write. 

The registration point is listed as the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a point in the form 
poi nt( horizonta 1, vertical). Nonvisual members such as sounds do not have a useful 
regPoint property. 

You can use the regPoi nt property to animate individual graphics in a film loop, changing the 
film loop’s position in relation to other objects on the Stage. 

You can also use regPoint to adjust the position of a mask being used on a sprite. 

When a Flash movie cast member is first inserted into the cast library, its registration point is its 
center and its centerRegPoi nt property is set to TRUE. If you subsequently use the regPoi nt 
property to reposition the registration point, the centerRegPoi nt property is automatically set 
to FALSE. 

Example 

This statement displays the registration point of the bitmap cast member Desk in the 
Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(member("Desk").regPoint) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(member("Desk").regPoint); 

This statement changes the registration point of the bitmap cast member Desk to the values in 
the list: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"Desk").regPoint = point(300, 400) 

// JavaScript syntax 

member!"Desk").regPoint = point(300, 400);

regPoint (3D) 

Usage 

spri te( whi chSpri te) . camera . backdrop \_backdropIndex~\ .regPoint 
member( whichCastmember) .camera( whichCamera) .backdrop 
\_backdropIndex~\ . regPoi nt 

Description 

3D backdrop and overlay property; allows you to get or set the registration point of the backdrop 
or overlay. The registration point represents the x, y, and z coordinates of the center of the 
backdrop or overlay in 3D space. The default value for this property is point(0,0). 

Example 

The following statement changes the registration point of the first backdrop of the camera of 
sprite 13. The backdrop’s registration point will be the point (50, 0), measured from the upper 
left corner of the backdrop. 

sprite(13).camera.backdrop[l].regPoint = point(50, 0) 

See also 

loc (backdrop and overlay) 

regPointVertex 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. regPoi ntVertex 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. regPoi ntVertex; 

Description 

Cast member property; indicates whether a vertex of vectorCastMember is used as the 
registration point for that cast member. If the value is zero, the registration point is determined 
normally, using the centerRegPoi nt and regPoi nt properties. If the value is nonzero, it 
indicates the position in the vertext Li st of the vertex being used as the registration point. The 
centerRegPoi nt is set to FALSE and the regPoi nt is set to the location of that vertex. 

Example 

This statement makes the registration point for the vector shape cast member Squiggle 
correspond to the location of the third vertex: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("squig g1e").regPointVertex=3 

// JavaScript syntax 

member("squig g1e").regPointVertex=3;

renderer 


Usage 

get Renderer ServicesO. renderer 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set the current renderer in use by a movie. The range of values 
for this property is determined by the list of available Tenderers returned by the Renderer Services 
object’s rendererDevi ceLi st property. 

Shockwave Player users have the option of specifying the renderer of their choice using the 3D 
Renderer context menu in Shockwave Player. If the user selects the “Obey content settings” 
option, the renderer specified by the renderer or preferred3DRenderer properties is used to 
draw the movie (if available on the users system), otherwise the renderer selected by the user 
is used. 

The default value for this property is determined by the preferred3DRenderer property. 

This property returns the same value as returned by the movie property the acti ve3dRenderer. 

Example 

This statement shows that the renderer currently being used by the user’s system is #openGL: 

put getRendererServices().renderer 
-- #openGL 

See also 

getRendererServices() , preferred3dRenderer , rendererDeviceList ,

rendererDeviceList 

Usage 

getRendererServices().rendererDevi ceLi st 

Description 

3D renderer property; returns a list of symbols identifying the Tenderers that are available for use 
on the client machine. The contents of this list determine the range of values that can be specified 
for the renderer and preferred3DRenderer properties. This property can be tested but not set. 

This property is a list that can contain the following possible values: 

• #openGL specifies the openGL drivers for a hardware acceleration which work with both 
Macintosh and Windows platforms. 

• #di rectX7_0 specifies the DirectX 7 drivers for hardware acceleration which work with 
Windows platforms only. 

• #di rectX5_2 specifies the DirectX 5.2 drivers for hardware acceleration which work with 
Windows platforms only. 

• #sof twa re specifies the Director built-in software renderer which works with both Macintosh 
and Windows platforms.

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set the textureRenderFormat for a specific texture by 
specifying one of the following values: 

#defaul t uses the value returned by getRendererServi ces (). textureRenderFormat. 

#rgba8888 

#rgba8880 

#rgba5650 

#rgba5550 

#rgba5551 

#rgba4444 

See textureRenderFormat for information on these values. 

Setting this property for an individual texture overrides the global setting set using 

textureRenderFormat. 

The renderFormat property determines the pixel format the Tenderer uses when rendering the 
specified texture. Each pixel format has a number of digits, with each digit indicating the color 
depth being used for red, green, blue, and alpha. The value you choose determines the accuracy of 
the color fidelity (including the precision of the optional alpha channel) and thus the amount of 
memory used on the video card. You can choose a value that improves color fidelity or a value that 
allows you to fit more textures into memory on the video card. You can fit roughly twice as many 
16-bit textures as 32-bit textures in the same space. 

Example 

The following statement sets the renderFormat property of the texture TexPic to #rgba4444. 
The red, blue, green, and alpha components of the texture will each be drawn using 4 bits of 
information. 

member!"3d").texture!"TexPic").renderFormat = #rgba4444

renderStyle 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember). shader( whichShader ).renderStyle 

Description 

3D standard shader property; allows you to get or set the renderStyl e for a shader, as 
determined by the geometry of the underlying model resource. This property has the 
following values: 

#fill specifies that the shader is drawn to completely fill the surface area of the model resource. 

#wire specifies that the shader is drawn only on the edges of the faces of the model resource. 

#point specifies that the shader is drawn only on the vertices of the model resource. 

All shaders have access to the (/standard shader properties; in addition to these standard shader 
properties shaders of the types #engra ver, #newspri nt, and #pai nter have properties unique to 
their type. For more information, see newShader. 

Example 

This statement causes the shader WallMaterial to be rendered only where it lies on top of a vertex 
of the underlying model resource: 

member("CityScene").shader!"Wal1Material").renderStyl e = #point 

resizable 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
windowObjRef. resi zabl e 

// JavaScript syntax

resolution (3D) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model Resource( whichModelResource) .resolution 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set the resolution property of a model resource whose type is 
either #sphere or # cyl i nder. 

Resolution controls the number of polygons used to generate the geometry of the model resource. 
A larger value generates more polygons and thus results in a smoother surface. The default value 
of this property is 20. 

Example 

This statement sets the resolution of the model resource named sphereOl to 10.0: 

member("3D World").model Resource!"sphereOl").resolution = 10.0 

resolution (DVD) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
dvdObjRef. resol uti on 

// JavaScript syntax 
dvdObjRef. resol uti on ; 

Description 

DVD property. Returns a property list that contains the x-axis (width) and y-axis (height) source 
resolution. Read-only. 

Possible x-axis values are 352, 704, or 720. 

Possible y-axis values are 240, 480, 288, or 576. 

Example 

This statement returns a sample property list of resolutions:

resolve 

Usage 

member ( whi chCastmember) .model (.whi chModel ) .colli si on.resolve 

Description 

3D collision property; allows you to get or set whether collisions are resolved when two models 
collide. If this property is set to TRUE for both models involved in a collision, both models come 
to a stop at the point of collision. If only one of the models has the resol ve property set to TRUE, 
that model comes to a stop, and the model with the property not set, or set to FALSE, continues to 
move. The default value for this property is TRUE. 

Example 

The following statement sets the resolve property of the collision modifier applied to the model 
named Box to TRUE. When the model named Box collides with another model that has the 
#col 1 i si on modifier attached, it will stop moving. 

member("3d world").model("Box").col 1ision.resolve = TRUE

romanLingo 

Usage 

the romanLingo 

Description 

System property; specifies whether Lingo uses a single-byte (TRUE) or double-byte interpreter 
(FALSE). 

The Lingo interpreter is faster with single-byte character sets. Some versions of Macintosh system 
software—Japanese, for example—use a double-byte character set. U.S. system software uses a 
single-byte character set. Normally, roman Li ngo is set when Director is first started and is 
determined by the local version of the system software. 

If you are using a non-Roman script system but don’t use any double-byte characters in your 
script, set this property to TRUE for faster execution of your Lingo scripts.

rootLock 

Usage 

member ( whi chCastmember) .model (whi chModel ). keyframe PI ay er. rootLock 
member (whi chCastmember) .model (.whi chModel ). bonesPl ay er. rootLock 

Description 

3D #keyf ramePl ayer and #bonesPl ayer modifier property; indicates whether the translational 
components of a motion are used (FALSE) or ignored (TRUE). 

The default value of this property is FALSE. 

Example 

This statement forces the model named Alien3 to remain at its starting position while executing 
its motions, resulting in a character that will walk in place: 

member!"newalien").model("A1ien3").keyframePlayer.rootLock = 1 

rootNode 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember).earnera(whichCamera) .rootNode 
sprite! whichSprite) .camera.rootNode 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set which objects are visible within a sprite. When a camera is 
first created, it shows all nodes within the world. The rootNode property allows you to modify 
this by creating a different default view that limits what’s shown to a particular node and 
its children. 

For example, light C is a child of model A., if you set the rootNode property to 
camera ("defaul tVi ew"). rootNode=model (A), the sprite will show only model A as 
illuminated by light C. The default is group! "worl d"), meaning that all nodes are used. 

Example 

The following statement sets the rootNode of the camera of sprite 5 to the model Pluto. Only 
Pluto and its children will be visible in sprite 5. 

sprite!5).camera.rootNode = member!"Scene").model("PIuto") 


rootNode 949 




rotation 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spriteObjRef .rotati on 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. rotati on ; 

Description 

Sprite property; controls the rotation of a QuickTime movie, animated GIF, Flash movie, or 
bitmap sprite within a sprite’s bounding rectangle, without rotating that rectangle or the sprite’s 
controller (in the case of QuickTime). Read/write. 

In effect, the sprite’s bounding rectangle acts as a window through which you can see the Flash or 
QuickTime movie. The bounding rectangles of bitmaps and animated GIFs change to 
accommodate the rotating image. 

Score rotation works for a Flash movie only if obeyScoreRotati on is set to TRUE. 

A Flash movie rotates around its origin point as specified by its ori gi nMode property. A 
QuickTime movie rotates around the center of the bounding rectangle of the sprite. A bitmap 
rotates around the registration point of the image. 

For QuickTime media, if the sprite’s crop property is set to TRUE, rotating the sprite frequently 
moves part of the image out of the viewable area; when the sprite’s crop property is set to FALSE, 
the image is scaled to fit within the bounding rectangle (which may cause image distortion). 

You specify the rotation in degrees as a floating-point number. 

The Score can retain information for rotating an image from +21,474,836.47° to 
-21,474,836.48°, allowing 59,652 full rotations in either direction. 

When the rotation limit is reached (slightly past the 59,652th rotation), the rotation resets to 
+ 116.47° or-116.48°—not 0.00°. This is because +21,474,836.47° is equal to +116.47°, and 
-21,474,836.48° is equal to -116.48° (or +243.12°). To avoid this reset condition, when you use 
script to perform continuous rotation, constrain the angles to ±360°. 

The default value of this property is 0. 

Example 

This behavior causes a sprite to rotate continuously by 2° every time the playhead advances, 
limiting the angle to 360°: 

-- Lingo syntax 
property spriteNum 

on prepareFrame me 

sprite(spriteNum).rotation = integer!sprite(spriteNum).rotati on + 2) mod 360 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function prepareFrame!) { 

sprite(this.spriteNum).rotation = parseInt(sprite(this.spriteNurn).rotation 
+ 2) % 360; 


950 Chapter 14: Properties 



The following frame script keeps the playhead looping in the current frame while it rotates a 
QuickTime sprite in channel 5 a full 360° in 16° increments. When the sprite has been rotated 
360°, the playhead continues to the next frame. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on rotateMovie(whichSprite) 
repeat with i = 1 to 36 

sprite(whichSprite).rotation = i * 10

Description 

3D shader engraver property; allows you to get or set an angle in degrees (as a floating-point 
number) that describes a 2D rotational offset for engraved lines. The default value for this 
property is 0.0. 

Example 

This statement rotates the lines used to draw the engraver shader for the model gbCyl3 by 1°:

rotation (transform) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .node! whichNode) .transform.rotation 
member! whichCastmember) .node! whichNode) .getWorldTransform!).rotation 
transform, rotati on 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set the rotational component of a transform. A transform 
defines a scale, position and rotation within a given frame of reference. The default value of this 
property is vector (0,0,0). 

A node can be a camera, group, light or model object. Setting the rotati on of a node’s transform 
defines that object’s rotation within the transform’s frame of reference. Setting the rotation 
property of an object’s world relative transform using getWorl dT ransform!). rotati on defines 
the object’s rotation relative to the world origin. Setting the rotati on property of an object’s 
parent relative transform using transform. rotati on defines the object’s rotation relative to 
its parent node. 

If you wish to modify the orientation of a transform it is recommended that you use the rotate 
and prerotate methods instead of setting this property. 

Example 

This statement sets the parent-relative rotation of the first camera in the member to 
vector(0,0,0): 

member ("Space"). camera [1]. transform. rotati on = vector!!), 0, 0) 


952 Chapter 14: Properties 



This example displays the parent-relative rotation of the model named Moon, then it adjusts the 
model’s orientation using the rotate command, and finally it displays the resulting world-relative

3D keyframePl ayer and bonesPl ayer modifier property; indicates the axes around which 
rotational changes are maintained from the end of one motion to the beginning of the next, or 
from the end of one iteration of a looped motion to the beginning of the next iteration. 

Possible values of this property include #none, #x, #y, #z, #xy, #yz, #xz, and #a 11. The default 
value is #a 11. 

Example

sampleCount 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

soundChannelObjRef. sampl eCount 

// JavaScript syntax 
soundChannelObjRef. sampl eCount; 

Description 

Sound Channel property; specifies the number of sound samples in the currently playing sound 
in a sound channel. Read-only. 

This is the total number of samples, and depends on the sampl eRate and durati on of the 
sound. It does not depend on the channel Count of the sound. 

A 1-second, 44.1 KHz sound contains 44,100 samples. 

Example 

This statement displays the name and sampleCount of the cast member currently playing in 
sound channel 1 in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax

Description 

Sound Channel property; returns, in samples per second, the sample rate of the sound cast 
member or in the case of SWA sound, the original file that has been Shockwave Audio-encoded. 
Read-only. 

This property is available only after the SWA sound begins playing or after the file has been 
preloaded using the preLoadBuffer() method. When a sound channel is given, the result is the 
sample rate of the currently playing sound cast member in the given sound channel. 

Typical values of this property are 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, and 44100. 


sampleRate 955 



When multiple sounds are queued in a sound channel, Director plays them all with the 
channel Count, samp! eRate, and sampl eSi ze of the first sound queued, resampling the rest for 
smooth playback. Director resets these properties only after the channel’s sound queue is 
exhausted or a stop ( ) method is issued. The next sound to be queued or played then 
determines the new settings. 

Example 

This statement assigns the original sample rate of the file used in SWA streaming cast member 
Paul Robeson to the field cast member Sound Quality: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"Sound Quality").text = string(member("Paul Robeson").sampleRate) 

// JavaScript syntax

scale (Member) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. seal e 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. scale; 

Description 

Cast member property and sprite property; controls the scaling of a QuickTime, vector shape, or 
Flash movie sprite. 

For QuickTime, this property does not scale the sprite’s bounding rectangle or the sprite’s 
controller. Instead, it scales the image around the image’s center point within the bounding 
rectangle. The scaling is specified as a Director list containing two percentages stored as float- 
point values: 

[xPercent, yPercentl 

The xPercent parameter specifies the amount of horizontal scaling; the yPercent parameter 
specifies vertical scaling. 

When the sprite’s crop property is set to TRUE, the seal e property can be used to simulate 
zooming within the sprite’s bounding rectangle. When the sprite’s crop property is set to FALSE, 
the scale property is ignored. 

This property can be tested and set. The default value is [1.0000,1.0000], 

For Flash movie or vector shape cast members, the scale is a floating-point value. The movie is 
scaled from its origin point, as specified by its ori gi nMode property. 

Note: This property must be set to the default value if the scaleMode property is set to fautoSize; 
otherwise the sprite does not display correctly. 

Example 

This handler accepts a reference to a Flash movie sprite as a parameter, reduces the movie’s 
scale to 0% (so it disappears), and then scales it up again in 5% increments until it is full size 
(100%) again: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on scaleMovie whichSprite 

sprite(whichSprite).seale = 0

member( whichCastmember) .node( whichNode) .getWorldTransform() .scale 

transform. seal e 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set the scaling component of a transform. A transform defines a 
scale, position and rotation within a given frame of reference. The scale property allows you to 
get and set the degree of scaling of the transform along each of the three axes. The default value of 
this property is vector (1.0,1.0,1.0). 

A node can be a camera, group, light or model object. This command does not have any visual 
effect on lights or cameras as they do not contain geometry. Setting the scale property of a node’s 
transform defines that object’s scaling along the X, Y and Z axes within the transform’s frame of 
reference. Getting the scale property of an object’s world relative transform using 
getWorl dTransform!). seal e returns the object’s scaling relative to the world origin. Setting the 
seal e property of an object’s parent relative transform using transform, seal e defines the 
object’s scaling relative to its parent node. 

Example 

This statement sets the scale property of the transform of the model named Moon to 
vector(2,5,3): 

member!"Scene").model("Moon").transform.scale = vector(2,5,3)

scaleMode 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. seal eMode 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. seal eMode ; 

Description 

Cast member property and sprite property; controls the way a Flash movie or vector shape is 
scaled within a sprite’s bounding rectangle. When you scale a Flash movie sprite by setting its 
scale and vi ewSca 1 e properties, the sprite itself is not scaled; only the view of the movie within 
the sprite is scaled. The seal eMode property can have these values: 

• #s howAl 1 (default for Director movies prior to version 7)—Maintains the aspect ratio of the 
original Flash movie cast member. If necessary, fill in any gap in the horizontal or vertical 
dimension using the background color. 


scaleMode 959 



• #noBorder—Maintains the aspect ratio of the original Flash movie cast member. If necessary, 
crop the horizontal or vertical dimension. 

• #exactFi t—Does not maintain the aspect ratio of the original Flash movie cast member. 
Stretch the Flash movie to fit the exact dimensions of the sprite. 

• #noScal e—preserves the original size of the Flash media, regardless of how the sprite is sized 
on the Stage. If the sprite is made smaller than the original Flash movie, the movie displayed in 
the sprite is cropped to fit the bounds of the sprite. 

• #autoSi ze (default)—This specifies that the sprite rectangle is automatically sized and 
positioned to account for rotati on, skew, fl i pH, and fl i pV. This means that when a Flash 
sprite is rotated, it will not crop as in earlier versions of Director. The #a uto S i z e setting only 
functions properly when scale, vi ewScal e, ori gi nPoi nt, and vi ewPoi nt are at their 
default values. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

The following sprite script checks the Stage color of the Director movie and, if the Stage color is 
indexed to position 0 in the current palette, the script sets the seal eMode property of a Flash 
movie sprite to #showAl 1. Otherwise, it sets the seal eMode property to #noBorder.

Description 

Movie property; provides indexed or named access to the script cast members of a movie. 
Read-only. 

The scriptNameOrNum argument can be either a string that specifies the name of the script cast 
member or an integer that specifies the number of the script cast member. 

• If scri ptNameOrNum is a string, the script property provides access to the script cast member, 
regardless of which cast library contains that member. 


962 Chapter 14: Properties 






• If scriptNameOrNum is an integer, the scri pt property provides access only to the script cast 
member found within the first cast library of the referenced movie; you cannot use indexed 
access to specify a cast library other than the first one.

Usage 

sprite( whichSprite). script Instance Li st 
the scriptlnstanceList of sprite uhichSprite 

Description 

Sprite property; creates a list of script references attached to a sprite. This property is available 
only during run time. The list is empty when the movie is not running. Modifications to the list 
are not saved in the Score. This property is useful for the following tasks: 

• Attaching a behavior to a sprite for use during run time

scriptsEnabled 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. scri ptsEnabl ed 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. scri ptsEnabl ed ; 


scriptsEnabled 965 



Description 

Director movie cast member property; determines whether scripts in a linked movie are enabled 
(TRUE or 1) or disabled (FALSE or 0). 

This property is available for linked Director movie cast members only. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement turns off scripts in the linked movie Jazz Chronicle: 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberC'Jazz Chroni cl e"). scri ptsEnabl ed = FALSE 
// JavaScript syntax 

memberC'Jazz Chroni cl e"). scri ptsEnabl ed = 0: 

scriptText 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef . scri ptText 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. scri ptText; 

Description 

Member property; indicates the content of the script, if any, assigned to a cast member. 

Read/write. 

The text of a script is removed when a movie is converted to a projector, protected, or compressed 
for Shockwave Player. Such movies then lose their values for the scri ptText property. Therefore, 
the movies scri ptText property values cannot be retrieved when the movie is played back by a 
projector. However, Director can set new values for the scri ptTex property inside the projector. 
These newly assigned scripts are automatically compiled so that they execute quickly. 

Example 

This statement makes the contents of field cast member 20 the script of cast member 30: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member(20).text = member(30).scriptText 
// JavaScript syntax 

member(20).text = member(30).scriptText;

966 Chapter 14: Properties 



scriptType 

Usage 

member whichScript .scriptType 

the scriptType of member whichScript 

Description 

Cast member property; indicates the specified script’s type. Possible values are #movi e, #score, 
and #parent. 

Example 

This statement makes the script member Main Script a movie script: 
memberC'Main Seri pt"). scri ptType = #movie 

scrollTop 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. scrol 1 Top 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef .scrol 1 Top; 

Description 

Cast member property; determines the distance, in pixels, from the top of a field cast member to 
the top of the field that is currently visible in the scrolling box. By changing the value for 
scrol 1 Top member property while the movie plays, you can change the section of the field that 
appears in the scrolling field. 

This is a way to make custom scrolling behaviors for text and field members. 

For example, the following Lingo moves the field cast member Credits up or down within a field’s 
box, depending on the value in the variable si i derVal: 

global sliderVal 

on prepareFrame 

newVal = sliderVal * 100 
member("Credits").scrol1 top = newVal 
end 

The global variable si i derVal could measure how far the user drags a slider. The statement set 
newVal = sliderVal * 100 multiplies si i derVal to give a value that is greater than the 
distance the user drags the slider. If si i derVal is positive, the text moves up; if si i derVal is 
negative, the text moves down. 


scrollTop 967 



Example 


This repeat loop makes the field Credits scroll by continuously increasing the value 
of scrol 1 Top: 

--Lingo syntax 
on wa 

member!"Credits").scrol 1 Top = 1 
repeat with count = 1 to 150 

member("Credits").scrol1 Top = member("Credits").scrol1 Top + 1 
_movie.updateStage!) 
end repeat 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function wa() { 

member("Credits").scrol1 Top = 1; 

for (var count = 1; count <= 150; count++) { 

member("Credits").scrol1 Top = member("Credits").scrol1 Top + 1; 
_movie.updateStage!); 


sds (modifier) 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel) .sds .whichProperty 

Description 

3D modifier; adds geometric detail to models and synthesizes additional details to smooth out 
curves as the model moves closer to the camera. After you have added the sds modifier to a model 
using addHodifier!), you can set the properties of the sds modifier. 

The sds modifier directly affects the model resource. Be careful when using the sds and 1 od 
modifiers together, because they perform opposite functions (the sds modifier adds geometric 
detail and the 1 od modifier removes geometric detail). Before adding the sds modifier, it is 
recommended that you set the 1 od . auto modifier property to FALSE and set the 1 od . 1 evel 
modifier property to the desired resolution, as follows: 

member!"myMember").model("myModel").1od.auto = 0 
member!"myMember").model("myModel").1od.1evel = 100 
member!"myMember").model("myModel").addmodifier(#sds) 

The sds modifier cannot be used with models that already use either the inker or toon 
modifiers. 

After you have added the sds modifier to a model resource you can get or set the 
following properties: 

enabl ed indicates whether subdivision surfaces functionality is enabled (TRUE) or disabled 
(FALSE). The default setting for this property is TRUE. 

depth specifies the maximum number of levels of resolution that the model can display when 
using the sds modifier. 

error indicates the level of error tolerance for the subdivision surfaces functionality. This 
property applies only when the sds . subdi vi si on property is set to #adapti ve. 


968 Chapter 14: Properties 



subdivision indicates the mode of operation of the subdivision surfaces modifier. Possible values 
are as follows: 

• #uni form specifies that the mesh is uniformly scaled up in detail, with each face subdivided 
the same number of times. 

• #adapti ve specifies that additional detail is added only when there are major face orientation 
changes and only to those areas of the mesh that are currently visible. 

Note: For more detailed information about these properties, see the individual property entries. 

Example 

The statement displays the sds . depth property value for the model named Terrain: 

put member!“3D”).model(“Terrain”).sds.depth 
--2

searchCurrentFolder 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.searchCurrentFolder 

// JavaScript syntax 
_p layer.searchCurrentFolder; 

Description 

Player property; determines whether Director searches the current folder when searching 
filenames. Read/write. 

• When the searchCurrentFol der property is TRUE (1), Director searches the current folder 
when resolving filenames. 

• When the searchCurrentFolder property is FALSE (0), Director does not search the current 
folder when resolving filenames. 

This property is TRUE by default. 

Example 

This statement displays the status of the searchCurrentFol der property in the Message 
window. The result is 1, which is the numeric equivalent of TRUE: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(_piayer.searchCurrentFolder) 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(_player.searchCurrentFol der);

searchCurrentFolder 969 



searchPathList 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.searchPathList 

// JavaScript syntax 
_player.searchPathList; 

Description 

Player property; a list of paths that Director searches when trying to find linked media such as 
digital video, GIFs, bitmaps, or sound files. Read/write. 

Each item in the list of paths is a fully qualified pathname as it appears on the current platform 
at runtime. 

The value ofsearchPathListisa linear list that you can manipulate the same as any other list by 
using commands such as add( ), add At (), appendO, del eteAt( ), and set At (). The default 
value is an empty list. 

URLs should not be used as file references in the search paths. 

Adding a large number of paths to searchPaths slows searching. Try to minimize the number of 
paths in the list. 

Note: This property will function on all subsequent movies after being set. Because the current 
movie's assets have already been loaded, changing the setting will not affect any of these assets. 

Example 

This statement displays the paths that Director searches when resolving filenames: 

-- Lingo syntax 

trace(_player.searchPathList) 

// JavaScript syntax 
trace(_player.searchPathList); 

The following statement assigns two folders to searchPaths in Windows: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.searchPathList = ["C:\Director\Projects\", "D:\CDROM\Sources\"] 

// JavaScript syntax 

_pl ayer. searchPathLi st = 1 i st("C : WDi rectorWProjectsW", 

"D: WCDROMWSourcesW"); 

The following statement assigns two folders to searchPaths on a Macintosh: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.searchPathList = ["Hard Drive:Director:Projects, ''CDROM:Sources:”] 

// JavaScript syntax 

_pl ayer. searchPathLi st = listC'Hard Dri ve : Di rector : Projects :",

shader 


Usage 

member( whichCastmember) . shader( whichShader) 
member( whichCastmember) .shader[ index ] 
member(whichCastmember) .model (whichModel) .shader 
member! whichCastmember) .model Resource! whichModelResource).\ 
facet index ].shader 

Description 

3D element, model property, and face property; the object used to define the appearance of the 
surface of the model. The shader is the “skin” which is wrapped around the model resource used 
by the model. 

The shader itself is not an image. The visible component of a shader is created with up to eight 
layers of texture. These eight texture layers are either created from bitmap cast members or 
image objects within Director or imported with models from 3D modeling programs. For more 
information, see texture. 

Every model has a linear list of shaders called the shaderlist. The number of entries in this list 
equals the number of meshes in the model resource used by the model. Each mesh can be shaded 
by only one shader. 

The 3D cast member has a default shader named Def aul tShader, which cannot be deleted. This 
shader is used when no shader has been assigned to a model and when a shader being used by a 
model is deleted. 

The syntax member! whi chCastmember) .model (whi chMode 1). shader gives access to the first 

shader in the model’s shaderlist and is equivalent to 

member! whichCastmember) .model (whichModel) .shaderListll], 

Create and delete shaders with the newShader!) and del eteShader!) commands. 

Shaders are stored in the shader palette of the 3D cast member. They can be referenced by name 
(wh i chShader) or palette index ( shaderlndex ). A shader can be used by any number of models. 
Changes to a shader will appear in all models which use that shader. 

There are four types of shaders: 

#standard shaders present their textures realistically. 

#pa i nter, #engraver, and #newspr i nt shaders stylize their textures for painting, engraving, and 
newsprint effects. They have special properties in addition to the #standard shader properties. 

For more information about shader properties, see the Using Director topics in the Director 
Fielp Panel.

shaderList 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember ).model (whichModel ).shaderList 
member! whichCastmember) .model (whichModel) ,shaderList[ index ] 

Description 

3D model property; a linear list of shadowPercentage applied to the model. The number of 
entries in this list equals the number of meshes in the model resource used by the model. Each 
mesh can be shaded by only one shader. 

Set the shader at the specified index position in the shaderlist with this syntax: 

member! whichCastmember ).model (whichModel) .shaderListE index ] = shader Reference 

With 3D text, each character is a separate mesh. Set the value of i ndex to the number of the 
character whose shader you want to set. 

Set all index positions in the shaderList to the same shader with this syntax (note the absence 
of an index for the shaderLi st): 

member! whichCastmember) .model (whichModel ).shaderLi st = shaderReference 

Set a property of a shader in the shaderlist with this syntax: 

member! whichCastmember ).model (whichModel) .shaderListE index ],\ 
whi chProperty = propValue 

Set a property of all of the shaders of a model to the same value with this syntax (note the absence 
of an index for the shaderList): 

member! whichCastmember ).model (whichModel ).shaderLi st.\ 
whi chProperty = propValue 

Example 

This statement sets the second shader in the shaderLi st of the model named Bumper to the 
shader named Chrome: 

member!"Car").model("Bumper").shaderLis t E 2] = \ 
member!"Car").shader!"Chrome") 

This statement sets the all the shaders in the shaderLi st of the model named Bumper to the 
shader named Chrome: 

member!"Car").model("Bumper").shaderLi st = \ 
member!"Car").shader!"Chrome")

shadowPercentage 

Usage 

member ( whi chCastmember) .model (.whi chModel ) .toon, shadow Percentage 
member! whichCastmember) .model( whichModel ).shader.shadowPercentage 
member! whichCastmember) .shader! whichShader) .shadowPercentage 

Description 

3D toon modifier and painter shader property; indicates the percentage of available colors that 
are used in the area of the model’s surface where light does not create highlights. 

The range of this property is 0 to 100, and the default value is 50. 

The number of colors used by the toon modifier and painter shader for a model is determined 
by the colorSteps property of the model’s toon modifier or painter shader. 

Example 

The following statement sets the shadowPercentage property of the toon modifier for the model 
named Teapot to 50. Half of the colors available to the toon modifier for this model will be used 
for the shadow area of the model’s surface. 

member("shapes").model("Teapot").toon.shadowPercentage = 50

shadowStrength 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel) .toon.shadowStrength 
member! whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel) .shader.shadowStrength 
member! whichCastmember) .shader! whichShader) .shadowStrength 

Description 

3D toon modifier and #pa i nter shader property; indicates the brightness of the area of the 
model’s surface where light does not create highlights. 

The default value of this property is 1.0. 

Example 

The following statement sets the shadowStrength property of the toon modifier for the model 
named Sphere to 0.1. The area of the model’s surface that is not highlighted will be very dark. 

member!"Shapes").model("Sphere").toon.shadowStrength = 0.1 


shadowStrength 977 



shapeType 

Usage 

member( whichCastMember) . shapeType 
the shapeType of member whichCastMember 

Description 

Shape cast member property; indicates the specified shape’s type. Possible types are #rect, 
#roundRect, #oval , and #1 i ne. You can use this property to specify a shape cast member’s type 
after creating the shape cast member using Lingo. 

Example 

These statements create a new shape cast member numbered 100 and then define it as an oval: 

new(#shape, member 100) 
member(lOO).shapeType = #oval 

shiftDown 

Syntax 

-- Lingo syntax 
_key.shiftDown 

// JavaScript syntax 
_key.shiftDown; 

Description 

Key property; indicates whether the user is pressing the Shift key. Read-only. 

This property returns TRUE if the user is pressing the Shift key; otherwise, it returns FALSE. 

This property must be tested in conjunction with another key. 

Example 

This statement checks whether the Shift key is being pressed and calls the handler doCapitalA 
if it is: 

-- Lingo syntax 
if (_key.shiftDown) then 
doCapitalA(_key.key) 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_key.shiftDown) { 
doCapitalA(_key.key);

shininess 


Usage 

member ( whichCastmember) .shader( whichShader) .shininess 
member( whichCastmember) .model (whichModel ) .shader.shininess 
member(iW77 chCastmember) .model (whi chModel ) .shaderListX 
shader Li stlndex~\ . shi ni ness 

Description 

3D standard shader property; allows you to get or set the shininess of a surface. Shininess is 
defined as the percentage of shader surface devoted to highlights. The value is an integer between 
0 and 100, with a default of 30. 

All shaders have access to the #standard shader properties; in addition to these standard shader 
properties shaders of the types #engraver, #newspri nt, and #pai nter have properties unique to 
their type. For more information, see newShader. 

Example 

The following statement sets the shininess property of the first shader in the shader list of the 
model gbCyl3 to 60. Sixty percent of the surface of the shader will be dedicated to highlights. 

member!"Scene").model ( "gbCyl 3" ).shader.shininess = 60 

silhouettes 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .model (whichModel) .inker.silhouettes 
member! whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel) .toon.silhouettes 

Description 

3D toon and i nker modifier property; indicates the presence (TRUE) or absence ( FALSE) oflines 
drawn by the modifier at the visible edges of the model. 

Silhouette lines are drawn around the model’s 2D image on the cameras projection plane. Their 
relationship to the model’s mesh is not fixed, unlike crease or boundary lines, which are drawn on 
features of the mesh. 

Silhouette lines are similar to the lines that outline images in a child’s coloring book. 

The default value for this property is TRUE. 

Example 

The following statement sets the silhouettes property of the inker modifier for the model 
named Sphere to FALSE. Lines will not be drawn around the profile of the model. 

member("Shapes").model("Sphere").inker.si 1houettes = FALSE 


silhouettes 979 



size 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. si ze 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. size; 

Description 

Member property; returns the size in memory, in bytes, of a specific cast member. Read-only 
Divide bytes by 1024 to convert to kilobytes. 

Example 

This line outputs the size of the cast member Shrine in a field named How Big: 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberC'How Big").text = stri ng(member( "shri ne"). si ze) 

// JavaScript syntax 

memberC'How Big").text = member ("shri ne"). si ze. toStri ng();

sizeRange 

Usage 

member( uhichCastmember ).model Resource 
( whichModelResource) .sizeRange.start 
modelResourceObjectReference .size Range.start 
member( whichCastmember ).model Resource 
( whichModelResource) .sizeRange.end 
model ResourceObjectReference .size Range.end 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model resource whose type is #pa rti cl e, this property allows you 
to get or set the start and end property of the model resource s sizeRange. Particles are 
measured in world units. 

The size of particles in the system is interpolated linearly between sizeRange.start and 
sizeRange.end over the lifetime of each particle. 

This property must be an integer greater than 0, and has a default value of 1. 

Example 

In this example, mrFount is a model resource of the type #parti cl e. This statement sets the 
sizeRange properties of mrFount. The first line sets the start value to 4, and the second line sets 
the end value to 1. The effect of this statement is that the particles of mrFount are size 4 when 
they first appear, and gradually shrink to a size of 1 during their lifetime. 

member("fountain").model Resource("mrFount").size Range.start = 4 
member!"fountain").modelResource!"mrFount").size Range.end = 1 


980 Chapter 14: Properties 



sizeState 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
windowObjRef .si zeState 

// JavaScript syntax 
windowObjRef .si zeState; 

Description 

Window property; returns the size state of a window. Read-only. 

The returned size state will be one of the following values: 

Size state Description 

#mi ni mi zed Specifies that the window is currently minimized. 

#maxi mi zed Specifies that the window is currently maximized. 

#normal Specifies that the window is currently neither minimized nor maximized. 


Example 

These statements maximize the window named Artists if it is not already maximized. 
-- Lingo syntax 

if (window("Artists").sizeState <> #maximized) then 
window( "Artists").maximi ze() 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 

if (window("Artists").sizeState != symbol("maximized")) { 
wi ndow( "Artists").maximi ze(); 

)

skew 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spri teObjRef. skew 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. skew; 

Description 

Sprite property; returns, as a float value in hundredths of a degree, the angle to which the vertical 
edges of the sprite are tilted (skewed) from the vertical. Read/write. 

Negative values indicate a skew to the left; positive values indicate a skew to the right. Values 
greater than 90° flip an image vertically. 

The Score can retain information for skewing an image from +21,474,836.47° to 
-21,474,836.48°, allowing 59,652 full rotations in either direction. 


skew 981 








When the skew limit is reached (slightly past the 59,652th rotation), the skew resets to +116.47° 
or -116.48°—not 0.00°. This is because +21,474,836.47° is equal to +116.47°, and 
-21,474,836.48° is equal to -116.48° (or +243.12°). To avoid this reset condition, constrain 
angles to ±360° in either direction when using script to perform continuous skewing. 

Example 

The following behavior causes a sprite to skew continuously by 2 degrees every time the playhead 
advances, while limiting the angle to 360 degrees. 

-- Lingo syntax 
property spriteNum 

on prepareFrame me 

sprite(spriteNum).skew = integer!sprite(spriteNum).skew + 2) mod 360 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function prepareFrame!) { 

sprite(this.spriteNum).skew = parselnt(sprite(this.spriteNum).skew + 2) 

X 360;

smoothness 

Usage 

member! whichTextmember) .smoothness 

member! whichCastMember) .model Resource! whichExt ruderModel Res ource)\ 

.smoothness 

Description 

3D extruder model resource and text property; allows you to get or set an integer controlling the 
number of segments used to create a 3D text cast member. The higher the number, the smoother 
the text appears. The range of this property is 1 to 10, and the default value is 5. 

For more information about working with extruder model resources and text cast members, 

see extrude3D. 

Example 

In this example, the cast member Logo is a text cast member. This statement sets the smoothness 
of Logo to 8. When Logo is displayed in 3D mode, the edges of its letters will be very smooth. 

member!"Logo").smoothness = 8 

In this example, the model resource of the model Slogan is extruded text. This statement sets the 
smoothness of Slogan’s model resource to 1, causing the Slogan’s letters to appear very angular. 

member!"Scene").model("SIogan").resource.smoothness = 1

sound (Member) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. sound 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. sound; 

Description 

Cast member property; controls whether a movie, digital video, or Flash movies sound is enabled 
(TRUE, default) or disabled (FALSE). Read/write. 

In Flash members, the new setting takes effect after the currently playing sound ends. 

To see an example of sound used in a completed movie, see the Sound Control movie in the 
Learning/Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

This handler accepts a member reference and toggles the member’s sound property on or off: 

-- Lingo syntax 

on ToggleSoundlwhichMember) 

membertwhichMember).sound = not(member(whichMember).sound) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 

function ToggleSoundlwhichMember) { 

membertwhichMember).sound = !(member(whichMember).sound);

sound (Player) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.sound[ intSoundChannelNum] 

// JavaScript syntax 
_player.sound[ intSoundChannelNum ]; 

Description 

Player property; provides indexed access to a Sound Channel object by using a Player property. 
Read-only. 

The f ntSoundChannel Num argument is an integer that specifies the number of the sound channel 
to access. 

The functionality of this property is identical to the top level sound () method. 


sound (Player) 983 




Example 

This statement sets the variable mySound to the sound in sound channel 3: 

-- Lingo syntax 

mySound = _player.sound[3] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var mySound = _player.sound[3]; 

See also 

Player, soundO, Sound Channel 

soundChannel (SWA) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. soundChannel 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. soundChannel ; 

Description 

Shockwave Audio (SWA) cast member property; specifies the sound channel in which the SWA 
sound plays. 

If no channel number or channel 0 is specified, the SWA streaming cast member assigns the 
sound to the highest numbered sound channel that is unused. 

Shockwave Audio streaming sounds can appear as sprites in sprite channels, but they play sound 
in a sound channel. Refer to SWA sound sprites by their sprite channel number, not their sound 
channel number. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement tells the SWA streaming cast member Frank Zappa to play in sound channel 3: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"Frank Zappa").soundChannel = 3 

// JavaScript syntax 

member!"Frank Zappa").soundChannel = 3; 


984 Chapter 14: Properties 



soundChannel (RealMedia) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. soundChannel 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. soundChannel ; 

Description 

RealMedia sprite or cast member property; allows you to get or set the sound channel used to play 
the audio in the RealMedia stream. Setting this property allows you to control the audio of a 
RealMedia stream using the Lingo sound methods and properties. Setting this property to a value 
outside the range 0-8 causes a Lingo error. This property has no effect if 

real PI ayerNati veAudi o () is set to TRUE. 

The default setting for this property is 0, which means that the RealMedia audio will play in the 
highest sound channel available, and the property’s value changes during playback depending on 
which channel is being used. When the RealMedia cast member is playing, this property reflects 
the sound channel currently in use. When the RealMedia cast member is stopped, this property 
reverts to 0. 

If you specify a channel (1-8) for this property and there are sounds currently playing in that 
channel (from other parts of the movie), they will be stopped and the RealMedia audio will play 
in the channel instead. 

Concurrently playing RealMedia cast members are not supported; if your movie contains 
RealMedia cast members that play concurrently, their sounds are played simultaneously in the 
same sound channel. 

Example 

The following examples show that the sound in the RealMedia stream in sprite 2 and the cast 
member Real will be played in sound channel 2. 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(2).soundChannel) -- 2 
put(member!"Real").soundChannel ) -- 2 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(sprite(2).soundChannel); // 2 

put(member!"Real").soundChannel); // 2 

The following examples assign sound channel 1 to the RealMedia stream in sprite 2 and the cast 
member Real. 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(2).soundChannel = 1 

member("Real").soundChannel = 1 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(2).soundChannel = 1; 

member("Real").soundChannel = 1;

soundDevice 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_sound.soundDev ice 

// JavaScript syntax 
_sound.soundDev ice; 

Description 

Sound property; allows the sound mixing device to be set while the movie plays. Read/write. 

The possible settings for soundDevi ce are the devices listed in soundDevi ceLi st. 

Several sound devices can be referenced. The various sound devices for Windows have 
different advantages. 

• MacroMix (Windows)—The lowest common denominator for Windows playback. This 
device functions on any Windows computer, but its latency is not as good as that of other 
devices. 

• QT3Mix (Windows)—Mixes sound with QuickTime audio and possibly with other 
applications if they use DirectSound. This device requires that QuickTime be installed and has 
better latency than MacroMix. 

• DirectSound (Windows)—Similar to QT3Mix, but provides higher latency. 

• MacSoundManager (Macintosh)—The only sound device available on the Macintosh. 

Example 

The following statement sets the sound device to the MacroMix for a Windows computer. If the 
newly assigned device fails, the soundDevi ce property is not changed. 

-- Lingo syntax 

_sound.soundDevice = "MacroMix" 

// JavaScript syntax 

_sound.soundDevice = "MacroMix"; 

See also 

Sound, soundDeviceList 

soundDeviceList 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_sound.soundDeviceList 

// JavaScript syntax 
_sound.soundDeviceList; 

Description 

Sound property; creates a linear list of sound devices available on the current computer. Read¬ 
only. 

For the Macintosh, this property lists one device, MacSoundManager. 


986 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 

This statement displays a typical sound device list on a Windows computer: 

-- Lingo syntax 
trace(_sound.soundDev ice List)

Sound, soundDevice 

soundEnabled 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_sound.soundEnabled 

// JavaScript syntax 
_sound.soundEnabled; 

Description 

Sound property; determines whether the sound is on (TRUE, default) or off (FALSE). Read/write. 

When you set this property to FALSE, the sound is turned off, but the volume setting is 
not changed. 

Example 

This statement sets soundEnabl ed to the opposite ofits current setting; it turns the sound on if it 
is off and turns it off if it is on: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_sound.soundEnabled = not(_sound.soundEnabled) 

// JavaScript syntax 

_sound.soundEnabled = !(_sound.soundEnabl ed); 

See also 

Sound 

soundKeepDevice 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_sound.sound KeepDevice 

// JavaScript syntax 
_sound.sound KeepDevice; 

Description 

Sound property; for Windows only, determines whether the sound driver unloads and reloads 
each time a sound needs to play. Read/write. 

The default value of this property is TRUE, which prevents the sound driver from unloading and 
reloading each time a sound needs to play. 


soundKeepDevice 987 



You may need to set this property to FALSE before playing a sound to ensure that the sound device 
is unloaded and made available to other applications or processes on the computer after the sound 
has finished. 

Setting this property to FALSE may adversely affect performance if sound playback is used 
frequently throughout the Director application. 

Example 

This statement sets the soundKeepDevi ce property to FALSE: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_sound.soundKeepDevice = FALSE 

// JavaScript syntax 

_sound.soundKeepDevice = false; 

See also 

Sound 

soundLevel 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_sound.soundLevel 

// JavaScript syntax 
_sound.soundLevel; 

Description 

Sound property; returns or sets the volume level of the sound played through the computers 
speaker. Read/write. 

Possible values range from 0 (no sound) to 7 (the maximum, default). 

In Windows, the system sound setting combines with the volume control of the external speakers. 
Thus, the actual volume that results from setting the sound level can vary. Avoid setting the 
soundLevel property unless you are sure that the result is acceptable to the user. It is better to set 
the individual volumes of the channels and sprites with the Sound Channel object’s vol ume 
property. 

These values correspond to the settings in the Macintosh Sound control panel. Using this 
property, script can change the sound volume directly or perform some other action when the 
sound is at a specified level. 

To see an example of soundLevel used in a completed movie, see the Sound Control movie in 
the Learning/Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable ol dSound equal to the current sound level: 

-- Lingo syntax 

oldSound = _sound.soundLevel 

// JavaScript syntax 

var oldSound = _sound.soundLevel ; 


988 Chapter 14: Properties 



This statement sets the sound level to 5: 

-- Lingo syntax 
_sound.soundLevel = 5 

// JavaScript syntax 
_sound.soundLevel = 5; 

See also 

Sound, volume (Windows Media) 

soundMixMedia 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_sound.soundMixMedia 

// JavaScript syntax 
_sound.soundMixMedia; 

Description 

Sound property; determines whether Flash cast members will mix their sound with sounds in the 
Score sound channels. Read/write. 

This property defaults to TRUE for movies made with Director 7 and later and FALSE for 
earlier ones. It is also valid only on Windows. 

When this property is TRUE, Flash cast members will mix their sound with sounds in the Score 
sound channels. Director takes over the mixing and playback of sounds from Flash cast members. 

It is possible that slight differences may occur in the way Flash sounds play back. To hear the 
Flash sounds exactly they would be rendered in Flash, set this property to FALSE. 

When this property is set to FALSE, Flash sounds will not be mixed and must be played at 
separate times.

specular (light) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember). 1 ight( whichLight ).specul ar 

Description 

3D light property; allows you to get or set whether specularity is on (TRUE) or off (FALSE). 
Specularity refers to the ability to have a highlight appear on a model where the light hitting the 
model is reflected toward the camera. The shininess of the model’s shader determines how large 
the specular portion of the highlight is. The value for this property is ignored for ambient lights. 
The default value for this property is TRUE. 

Note: Turning off this property may increase performance. 

Example 

The following statement sets the specular property of the light omni2 to FALSE. This light does 
not cause highlights. If this is the only light currently shining in the scene, there will be no 
specular highlights on any of the shaders in the scene. 

member("3d world").1ight("omni2").specular = FALSE 

See also 

silhouettes, specularLightMap 

specular (shader) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember). shader( whichShader) .specular 

Description 

3D standard shader property; allows you get or set the specular color of a given shader. The 
specular color is the color of the highlight generated when specularity is turned on. There must be 
lights in the scene with the specular property set to TRU E, for this property to have a visible effect. 
The specular color is influenced by the color of the lights illuminating the object. If the specular 
color is white but the color of a light is red, there will be a red specular highlight appearing on the 
object. The default value for this property is rgb(255, 255, 255) which is white. 

All shaders have access to the #standard shader properties; in addition to these standard shader 
properties shaders of the types #engraver, #newspri nt, and #pai nter have properties unique to 
their type. For more information, see newShader.

specularColor 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).specularColor 

Description 

3D cast member property; allows you to get or set the RGB value of the specular color of the first 
shader in the cast member. The first shader in the cast members shader palette is always the 
default shader. This and all other 3D cast member properties are saved with the cast member and 
are restored the next time you open the movie. The default value for this property is rgb(255, 
255, 255) which is white. 

Example 

The following statement sets the specular color of the first shader in the cast member Scene to 
rgb(255, 0, 0). It is equivalent to member( "Scene"). shader[l]. specul ar = rgb (255 , 0, 

0). However, that syntax won’t save the new value with the cast member when the movie is saved. 
Only member .specularColor will save the new color value. 

membert"Scene").specul arCol or = rgb(255, 0, 0)

member( whichCastmember ).model ( whichModel) ,shaderList\ 

\_ shader Li stlndex ~\. specul arLi ghtMap 

Description 

3D standard shader property; allows you to get or set the fifth texture layer of a given standard 
shader. This property is ignored if the toon modifier is applied to the model resource. 

The values that can be set are as follows: 

• textureModeLis t C 5] = #specular 

• bl endFunctionLi stC5] = #add 

• bl endFunctionLi st [ 1 ] =#replace 

• default = void 

This helper property provides a simple interface for setting up a common use of specular 
light mapping. 

All shaders have access to the #standard shader properties; in addition to these standard shader 
properties shaders of the types #engraver, #newspri nt, and #pai nter have properties unique to 
their type. For more information, see the newShader.

Example 

This statement sets the texture Oval as the specularLightMap of the shader used by the 
model GlassBox: 

member("3DP1a net").model("G1assBox").shader.specularLightMap = \ 
member!"3DP1anet").texture!"Oval")

spotAngle 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) . 1 i ght! whichLight) .spotAngle 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set the angle of the light projection cone. Light that is falls 
outside of the angle specified for this property, contributes no intensity. This property takes float 
value between 0.0 and 180.00, and has a default value of 90.0. The float value you specify 
corresponds to half the angle; for instance if you wish to specify a 90° angle you would pass a 
value of 45.0. 

Example 

This statement sets the spotAngl e property of the light unidirectional to 8. The angle of the light 
projection cone will be 16°: 

member!"3d world").1ight!"unidirectional").spotAngle = 8 

spotDecay 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) . 1 i ght! whichLight) . spotDecay 

Description 

3D light property; allows you get or set whether a spotlight’s intensity falls off with the distance 
from the camera. The default value for this property is FALSE. 

Example 

The following statement sets the spotDecay property of light 1 to TRUE. Models that are farther 
away from light 1 will be less brightly lit than models that are closer to it. 

member!"Scene").1ight[1].spotDecay = TRUE 


spotDecay 993 



sprite (Movie) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.sprit elspriteNameOrNum ] 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.spri telspri teNameOrNum ]; 

Description 

Movie property; provides indexed or named access to a movie sprite. Read-only. 

The spri teNameOrNum argument can be either a string that specifies the name of the sprite or an 
integer that specifies the number of the sprite. 

Example 

The following statement sets the variable sportSprite to the movie sprite 5: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sportSprite = _movie.sprit e[5] 

// JavaScript syntax 

var sportSprite = _movie.sprite[5];

Movi e 

sprite (Sprite Channel) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spriteChannelObjRef. sprite 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teChannelObjRef. spri te ; 

Description 

Sprite Channel property; returns a reference to the sprite in the current frame of a sprite channel. 
Read-only. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable my Spri te to the sprite in the sprite channel named Ribbon. 

-- Lingo syntax 

mySprite = channel("Ribbon").sprite 
// JavaScript syntax 

var mySprite = channel("Ribbon").sprite;

994 Chapter 14: Properties 



spriteNum 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
spriteObjRef .spri teNum 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. spri teNum; 

Description 

Sprite property; determines the channel number the behavior’s sprite is in and makes it available 
to any behaviors. Read-only. 

Simply declare the property at the top of the behavior, along with any other properties the 
behavior may use. 

If you use a new( ) handler to create an instance of the behavior, the script’s new( ) handler must 
explicitly set the spri teNum property to the sprite’s number. This provides a way to identify the 
sprite the script is attached to. The sprite’s number must be passed to the new( ) handler as an 
argument when the new( ) handler is called. 

Example 

In this handler, the spri teNum property is automatically set for script instances that are created by 
the system: 

-- Lingo syntax 

property spriteNum, pMySpriteRef 
on mouseDown me 

sprite(spriteNum).member = member!"DownPict") 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDown!) { 

sprite(this.spriteNum).member = member!"DownPict"); 

1 


This handler uses the automatic value inserted into the spri teNum property to assign the sprite 
reference to a new property variable pMySpri teRef, as a convenience: 

-- Lingo syntax 

property spriteNum, pMySpriteRef 
on beginSprite me 

pMySpriteRef = sprite(me.spriteNum) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function beginSprite!) { 

this.pMySpriteRef = sprite(this.spriteNum); 

1 


spriteNum 995 



This approach allows the use of the reference pMySpri teRef later in the script, with the handler 
using the syntax: 

-- Lingo syntax 

currMember = pMySpriteRef.member 

// JavaScript syntax 

var currMember = pMySpriteRef.member 

instead of the following syntax which is somewhat longer: 

-- Lingo syntax 

currMember = sprite(spriteNum).member 
// JavaScript syntax 

var currMember = sprite(this.spriteNum).member 

This alternative approach is merely for convenience, and provides no different functionality.

stage 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.stage 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.stage; 

Description 

Movie property; refers to the main movie. Read-only. 

This property is useful when sending a message to the main movie from a child movie. 

Example 

This statement displays the current setting for the Stage: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(_movie.stage.rect) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(_movie.stage.rect);

startAngle 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource( whichModelResource). 
startAngle 

model ResourceObjectReference .startAngl e 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model resource whose type is #cy 1 i nder or ^sphere, this 
command allows you to both get and set the sta rtAngl e property of the referenced model 
resource, as a floating-point value from 0.0 to 360.0. The default value for this property is 0.0. 

The startAngl e property determines the starting sweep angle of the model resource, and works 
in conjunction with the endAngl e property to draw spheres and cylinders. For example, if you 
want to make a half sphere, set startAngl e to 0.0 and endAngl e to 180.0. 

Example 

The following statement sets the startAngle of the model resource SphereOl to 0.0. If its 
endAngl e is set to 90, then only one quarter of any model that uses this model resource 
will appear. 

put member("3D World").model Resource!"SphereOl").startAngle 

-- 0.0 

See also 

endAngle 

startFrame 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri teObjRef .startFrame 

// JavaScript syntax 
spri teObjRef. startFrame; 

Description 

Sprite property; returns the frame number of the starting frame of a sprite span. Read-only. 

This property is useful in determining the span in the Score that a particular sprite covers. It is 
available only in a frame that contains the sprite, and cannot be applied to sprites in different 
frames of the movie. 

Example 

This statement displays the starting frame of the sprite in channel 5 in the Message window: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(sprite(5).start Frame) 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(sprite(5).start Frame); 

See also 

endFrame, Sprite 


startFrame 997 



startTime 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
soundChannelObjRef .startTime 

// JavaScript syntax 
soundChannelObjRef .startTime; 

Description 

Sound Channel property; indicates the start time of the currently playing or paused sound as set 
when the sound was queued. Read-only. 

This property cannot be set after the sound has been queued. If no value was supplied when the 
sound was queued, this property returns 0. 

Example 

This statement starts the digital video sprite in channel 5 at 100 ticks into the digital video: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(5).startTime = 100 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(5).startTime = 100;

startTimeList 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
dvdObjRef. startTi me Li st 

// JavaScript syntax 
dvdObjRef. startT i me Li st; 

Description 

DVD property; a property list that specifies the time or chapter at which playback starts. 

Read/write. 

A startTi me Li st is a property list that can be either chapter based or time based. 

A chapter-based sta rtTi meLi st contains the following properties: 

• title. Specifies the title that contains the chapter to play. 

• chapter. Specifies the chapter to play. 

A time-based startTimeList contains the following properties: 

• title. Specifies the title. 

• hours. Specifies the hour at which playback starts. 

• min. Specifies the minute at which playback starts. 

• sec. Specifies the second at which playback starts. 


998 Chapter 14: Properties 



• frames. Specifies the frames at which playback starts. 

The startTimeLi st can be cleared by setting it to 0. 

Example 

This startTimeList starts playing at chapter 4 of title 1: 

[#title:l, #chapter:4] 

This startTimeLi st starts playing at a specific time in title 1: 

[#tiHe:l, #hours:0, #minutes:55, #seconds:45, #frames:15] 

This startTimeList only lists one time parameter: 

[#title:l, #seconds:45]

state (3D) 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) . state 

Description 

3D property; returns the current state of the referenced member in the streaming and loading 
process. This property refers to the initial file import or the last file load requested. 

The state property of the member determines what, if any, 3D Lingo can be performed on the 
cast member. 

This property can have any of the following values: 

• 0 —indicates that the member is currently not loaded and therefore no 3D media are available. 
No 3D Lingo should be performed on the member. 

• 1—indicates that the media loading has begun. 

• 2—indicates that the members initial load segment is loaded. All objects with a stream priority 
of zero, as set upon creation of the model file, will be loaded at this time, because they are part 
of the initial load segment. You can perform most 3D Lingo associated with objects that have a 
load priority of zero. Do not use the 1 oadFi 1 e and resetWorl d commands during this state. 

• 3 —indicates that all the additional media of the member are being loaded and decompressed. 
Most 3D Lingo can be performed at this point. Do not use the 1 oadFi 1 e and resetWorl d 
commands during this state. 

• 4 —indicates that all of the members media have been loaded and all decompression is 
complete. All 3D Lingo can now be performed on the cast member. 

• -1—indicates that an undefined error occurred during the media streaming process. Because 
the error may have occurred at any point during the loading process, the state of the cast 
member is not reliable. 

In general, avoid using Lingo on 3D cast members with a current state lower than 3. 


state (3D) 999 



Example 

This statement shows that the cast member named PartyScene has finished loading and preparing 
for playback, and no errors occurred during the load: 

put member("PartyScene").state 
-- 4 

state (Flash, SWA) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef .state 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. state; 

Description 

Cast member property; for Shockwave Audio (SWA) streaming cast members and Flash movie 
cast members, determines the current state of the streaming file. The properties streamName, 
URL, and preLoadTi me can be changed only when the SWA sound is stopped. 

The following properties for the SWA file return meaningful information only after the file 
begins streaming: cuePoi ntNames, cuePoi ntTimes, currentTi me, durati on, percentPl ayed, 
per cent St reamed, bi tRate, samp! e Rate, and numChannel s . 

For SWA streaming cast members, the following values are possible: 

• 0—Cast streaming has stopped. 

• 1—The cast member is reloading. 

• 2—Preloading ended successfully. 

• 3—The cast member is playing. 

• 4—The cast member is paused. 

• 5—The cast member has finished streaming. 

• 9—An error occurred. 

• 10—There is insufficient CPU space. 

For Flash movie cast members, this property returns a valid value only when the Director movie is 
running. The following values are possible: 

• 0—The cast member is not in memory. 

• 1—The header is currently loading. 

• 2—The header has finished loading. 

• 3—The cast member’s media is currently loading. 

• 4—The cast member’s media has finished loading. 

• -1—An error occurred. 

This property can be tested but not set.

state (RealMedia) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. state 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. state; 

Description 

RealMedia sprite or cast member property; returns the current state of the RealMedia stream, 
expressed as an integer in the range 1 to 4. Each state value corresponds to a specific point in the 
streaming process. This property is dynamic during playback and can be tested but not set. 


state (RealMedia) 1001 



The streaming process is initiated when the playhead enters the span of the RealMedia sprite in 
the Score, the pi ay method is invoked on a RealMedia sprite or cast member, or a user clicks the 
Play button in the RealMedia viewer. Calling this property returns a numeric value indicating the 
state of the streaming process for the RealMedia cast member. For each state, there is one or more 
corresponding medi aStatus (RealMedia, Windows Medi a ) property value; each medi aStatus 
value is observed only in one state. For example, the medi aStatus property values (/seeki ng and 
(/bufferi ng are present only when the value of state is 3. 

The value of the state property provides important information in terms of performing Lingo 
on a cast member. If member. state is less than 2, some of the Lingo properties may be incorrect, 
and as a result, any Lingo relying on property data would be incorrect. When member .state is 
greater than or equal to 2 and less than 4, the RealMedia cast member is not displayed, but all the 
Lingo properties and methods have well-defined values and can be used to perform Lingo 
operations on the cast member. 

When the streaming process is initiated, the state property cycles through the following states, 
unless an error (-1) occurs, which prevents the streaming process from starting: 

-1 (error) indicates that there is something wrong, possibly a leftover error from the previous 
RealMedia stream. You may get more information by checking the TastError property. This 
state is the equivalent of (/error for the medi aStatus property. 

0 (closed) indicates that streaming has not begun, or that cast member properties are in initial 
states or are copies from an earlier playing of the cast member. This state is the equivalent of 
(/cl osed for the medi aStatus property. 

1 (connecting) indicates that streaming has begun but is in the very early stages of connecting to 
the server, and there is not enough information available locally to do anything with the cast 
member. This state is the equivalent of (/connecti ng for the medi aStatus property. 

2 (open) indicates that the Lingo properties have been refreshed from the actual stream. When 
state is greater than or equal to 2, the hei ght, wi dth, and durati on properties of the 
RealMedia stream are known. This state is transitory and quickly changes to state 3. This state is 
the equivalent of (/opened for the medi aStatus property. 

3 (seeking or buffering) indicates that all of the RealMedia cast member’s Lingo properties are 
current, but the cast member is not quite ready to play. The Stage or RealMedia viewer displays a 
black rectangle or the RealNetworks logo. If this state is the result of rebuffering due to network 
congestion, the state value quickly changes back to 4 (playing). This state is the equivalent of 
(/buffering or (/seeking for the medi aStatus property. 

4 (playing) indicates that the RealMedia stream is playing (or paused) without problems or 
errors. This is the state during normal playback. This state is the equivalent of (/pi ay i ng or 
(/paused for the medi aStatus property. 

Example 

The following examples show that the state of streams in sprite 2 and the cast member Real is 0, 
which is closed: 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(sprite(2).state) -- 0 
put(member!"Real").state) -- 0 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(sprite(2).state); // 0 
put(member("Real").state); // 0

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. stati c 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. stati c; 

Description 

Cast member property and sprite property; controls playback performance of a Flash movie sprite 
depending on whether the movie contains animation. If the movie contains animation (FALSE, 
default), the property redraws the sprite for each frame; if the movie doesn’t contain animation 
(TRUE), the property redraws the sprite only when it moves or changes size. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Note: Set the stati c property to TRUE only when the Flash movie sprite does not intersect other 
moving Director sprites. If the Flash movie intersects moving Director sprites, it may not redraw 
correctly. 

Example 

This sprite script displays in the Message window the channel number of a Flash movie sprite and 
indicates whether the Flash movie contains animation:

Description 

Cast member property; reports an integer value indicating the total number of bytes in the stream 
for the specified cast member. The streamSi ze property returns a value only when the Director 
movie is playing. 

This property can be tested but not set. 

Example 

The following frame script checks to see if a Flash movie cast member named Intro Movie has 
finished streaming into memory. If it hasn’t, the script updates a field cast member to indicate the 
number of bytes that have been streamed (using the bytesStreamed member property) and the 
total number of bytes for the cast member (using the streamSi ze member property). The script 
keeps the playhead looping in the current frame until the movie finishes loading into memory.

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef .strokeWi dth 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef .strokeWi dth; 

Description 

Vector shape cast member property; indicates the width, in pixels, of the shape’s framing stroke. 

The value is a floating-point number between 0 and 100 and can be tested and set. 

To see an example of strokeWidth used in a completed movie, see the Vector Shapes movie in 
the Learning/Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

The following code sets the strokeWi dth of cast member “line” to 10 pixels: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"1ine").strokeWidth = 10 

// JavaScript syntax 

member!"1ine").strokeWidth = 10; 

style 

Usage 

member( uhichCastmember ).model ( whichModel ).toon.sty 1 e 
member( whichCastmember ).model (whichModel) .shader.styl e 
member! whichCastmember) .shader! whichShader) .style 

Description 

3D toon modifier and pai nter shader property; indicates the way the toon modifier and 
painter shader apply color to a model. Possible values are as follows: 

• #toon uses sharp transitions between colors. 

• #gradi ent uses smooth transitions between colors. This is the default value. 

• #bl ackAndWhi te uses two-color black and white. 

The number of colors used by the toon modifier and painter shader is set with the colorSteps 
property of the modifier or shader. 

Example 

The following statement sets the style property of the toon modifier for the model 
named Teapot to #bl ackAndWhi te. The model will be rendered in two-color black and white. 

member!"Shapes").model("Teapot").toon.style = #blackAndWhite

subdivision 


Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model iwhichModel ).sds.subdivisi on 

Description 

3D sds modifier property; allows you to get or set the subdivision surfaces mode of operation. 
Possible values are as follows: 

• #uni form specifies that the mesh is uniformly scaled up in detail, with each face subdivided 
the same number of times. 

• #adapti ve specifies that additional detail is added only when there are large surface 
orientation changes and only to those areas of the mesh that are currently visible. 

The sds modifier cannot be used with the i nker or toon modifiers, and caution should be 
used when using the sds modifier with the 1 od modifier. See the sds modifier entry for more 
information. 

Example 

The following statement sets the subdivision property of the sds modifier of the model named 
Baby to #adapti ve. Baby’s geometry will not be modified uniformly. 

membert"Scene").model("Baby").sds.subdivisi on = fadaptive

subPicture 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
dvdObjRef. subPi cture 

// JavaScript syntax 
dvdObjRef. subPi cture; 

Description 

DVD property. Determines the current subpicture, if any. Read/write. 

The value of subPi cture is an integer. A value of 0 disables subPi cture.

suspendUpdates 

Usage 

sprite( which3dSprite ).suspendUpdates 

Description 

3D sprite property; when set to TRUE, causes the sprite not to be updated as part of normal screen 
redraw operations. This can improve movie playback performance. Certain kinds of screen 
updates will still affect the sprite, such as those due to dragging another window over the sprite. 
When the suspendUpdates property is set to FALSE, the sprite is redrawn normally. 

It is important to keep the suspendUpdates property set to FALSE while any element within the 
3D sprite is being animated. 

switchColorDepth 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

_player.switchColorDepth 

// JavaScript syntax 
_player.switchColorDepth; 

Description 

Player property; determines whether Director switches the monitor that the Stage occupies to the 
color depth of the movie being loaded (TRUE) or leaves the color depth of the monitor unchanged 
when a movie is loaded (FALSE, default). Read/write. 

When swi tchCol orDepth is TRUE, nothing happens until a new movie is loaded. 

Setting the monitors color depth to that of the movie is good practice. 

• When the monitor’s color depth is set below that of the movie, resetting it to the color depth of 
the movie (assuming that the monitor can provide that color depth) helps maintain the movies 
original appearance. 

• When the monitor’s color depth is higher than that of the movie, reducing the monitor’s color 
depth plays the movie using the minimum amount of memory, loads cast members more 
efficiently, and causes animation to occur more quickly. 

The value of this property can also be set using the Reset Monitor to Movie’s Color Depth option 
in the General Preferences dialog box. 

Example 

This statement sets the variable named switcher to the current setting of swi tchCol orDepth: 

-- Lingo syntax 

switcher = _player.switchCol orDepth 


1012 Chapter 14: Properties 



// JavaScript syntax 

var switcher = _piayer.switchCol orDepth ; 

This statement checks whether the current color depth is 8-bit and turns the swi tchCol orDepth 
property on if it is: 

-- Lingo syntax 

if (_system.colorDepth = 8) then 
_player.switchColorDepth = TRUE 
end i f 

// JavaScript syntax 
if (_system.colorDepth == 8) { 

_player.switchColorDepth = true;

_movie.displayTempi ate.systemT ray Icon 
windowObjRef .systemTraylcon 

// JavaScript syntax 

_movie.displayTempi ate.systemT ray Icon; 
windowObjRef. systemTraylcon; 

Description 

Movie and Windows property (Microsoft Windows only). Determines whether a window has an 
icon in the system tray of a user’s desktop. Read/write. 

If systemT ray Icon is TRUE, a window icon is placed in the system tray. 

If systemTraylcon is FALSE, no icon appears in the system tray.

tabCount 

Usage 

chunkExpression .tabCount 

Description 

Text cast member property; indicates how many unique tab stops are in the specified chunk 
expression of the text cast member. 

The value is an integer equal to or greater than 0, and may be tested but not set. 

tabs 

Usage 

member! whichTextMember ).tabs 

Description 

Text cast member property; this property contains a list of all the tab stops set in the text 
cast member. 

Each element of the list contains information regarding that tab for the text cast member. The 
possible properties in the list are as follows: 

♦type Can be #1 eft, #center, #ri ght, or ^decimal. 

♦position Integer value indicating the position of the tab in points. 


You can get and set this property. When tabs is set, the type property is optional. If type is not 
specified, the tab type defaults to #1 eft. 

Example 

This statement retrieves and displays in the Message window all the tabs for the text cast member 
Intro credits: 

put member!"Intro credits").tabs 

-- I[#type: #left, imposition: 36], [#type: #Decimal, Imposition: 141], \ 

[#type: flright, imposition: 216]]

target 


Usage 

timeoutObject .target 

Description 

Timeout object property; indicates the child object that the given timeoutObject will send its 
timeout events to. Timeout objects whose target property is VOID will send their events to a 
handler in a movie script. 

This property is useful for debugging behaviors and parent scripts that use timeout objects. 

Example 

This statement displays the name of the child object that will receive timeout events from the 
timeout object timerOne in the Message window: 

put timeout(“timerOne”).target 

See also 

name (timeout), timeout!), timeoutHandler , timeoutList 

targetFrameRate 

Usage 

spri te( uhich3dSprite). target Frame Rate 

Description 

3D sprite property; determines the preferred number of frames per second to use when rendering 
a 3D sprite. The default value is 30 frames per second. The targetFrameRate property is only 
used if the useTargetFrameRate property is set to TRUE. If the us eTar get Frame Rate property is 
set to TRUE, Director will reduce the polygon count of the models in the sprite if necessary to 
maintain the specified frame rate. 

Example 

These statements set the targetFrameRate property of sprite 3 to 45 and enforce the frame rate 
by setting the useTargetFrameRate property of the sprite to TRUE: 

sprit e(3).targetFrameRate = 45 
sprite(3).useTargetFrameRate = TRUE 

See also 

useTargetFrameRate 


targetFrameRate 1015 



tension 


Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model (whichModel ).sds.tens ion 

Description 

3D subdivision surface property; allows you to get or set a floating-point percentage between 0.0 
and 100.0 that controls how tightly the newly generated surface matches the original surface. The 
higher this value, the more tightly the subdivided surface matches the original surface. The 
default is 65.0. 

Example 

The following statement sets the tensi on property of the sds modifier of the model Baby to 35. 
If the sds modifier’s error setting is low and its depth setting is high, this statement will have a 
very pronounced effect on Baby’s geometry. 

member("scene").model("Baby").sds.tension = 35 

See also 

sds (modi tier), error, depth (3D) 

text 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. text 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. text; 

Description 

Text cast member property; determines the character string in the field cast member specified by 

whi chCastMember. 

The text cast member property is useful for displaying messages and recording what the 
user types. 

This property can be tested and set. 

When you use Lingo to change the entire text of a cast member you remove any special 
formatting you have applied to individual words or lines. Altering the text cast member 
property reapplies global formatting. To change particular portions of the text, refer to lines, 
words, or items in the text. 

When the movie plays back as an applet, this property’s value is "" (an empty string) for a field 
cast member whose text has not yet streamed in. 

To see an example of text used in a completed movie, see the Forms and Post, and Text movies 
in the Learning/Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder.

Resource) . texture 

Description 

3D element and shader property; an image object used by a shader to define the appearance of the 
surface of a model. The image is wrapped onto the geometry of the model by the shader. 

The visible component of a shader is created with up to eight layers of textures. These eight 
texture layers are either created from bitmap cast members or image objects within Director or 
imported with models from 3D modeling programs. 

Create and delete textures with the newTexture! ) and del eteTexture! ) commands. 

Textures are stored in the texture palette of the 3D cast member. They can be referenced by name 
(whichTexture) or palette index ( texturelndex ). A texture can be used by any number of 
shaders. Changes to a texture will appear in all shaders which use that texture. 

There are three types of textures: 

#f romCastmember; the texture is created from a bitmap cast member using the 
newTexture!) command. 

#f romlmageObject; the texture is created from a lingo image object using the 
newTexture!) command. 

#i mportedFromFi 1 e; the texture is imported with a model from a 3D modeling program. 


texture 1017 



For more information about texture properties, see the Using Director topics in the Director 
Help Panel. 

The texture of a particle system is a property of the model resource, whose type is #pa rti cl e. 

Example 

This statement sets the texture property of the shader named WallSurface to the texture named 
BluePaint: 

member("Room").shader("Wal1 Surface").texture = \

textureCoordinateList 

Usage 

member! uhichCastmember) .model Resource! whichmodelResource). 
textureCoordinateList 

model ResourceObjectReference . textureCoordi nateLi st 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model resource whose type is #mesh, or with a meshDeform 
modifier attached to a model, this property allows you to get or set the textureCoordi nateLi st 
property of the model resource. 

The textureCoordi nateLi st property is a list of sublists identifying locations in an image that 
are to be used when texture mapping a triangle. Each sublist consists of two values indicating a 
location in a texture map. The values must be between 0.0 and 1.0 so that they can be scaled to 
arbitrarily sized texture maps. The default is an empty list. 

Manipulate model Resource, fa ce[ index], textureCoordi nates or 

model . meshdeform.mesh[i ndex]. facet i ndex] to change the mapping between 

textureCoordi nates and the corners of a mesh face.

Description 

3D meshdeform modifier properties; using these properties you can get and set information 
about the texture layers of a specified mesh. 

You can have up to eight texture layers for a shader, each layer can contain only one texture, but 
the same texture can be specified for more than one layer. Texture layers are layers of textures used 
by shaders. 

Use the following properties to access and manipulate texture layers: 

meshdeform. mesh [i ndex]. texturel ayer.count returns the number of texture layers for the 
specified mesh. 

model . meshdeform.mesh[i ndex]. texturel ayer . add!) adds an empty texture layer to the 
specified mesh. 

model . meshdeform. mesh [i ndex]. texturel ayer [index], text urecoordinatelist allows 
you to set or get a list of textureCoordinates for a particular layer of the specified mesh. You can 
also use this property to copy texture coordinates between texture layers as follows: 

model.meshdeform.texturelayer[a].texturecoordinatelist = \ 
model .meshdeform.texturelayer[b].texturecoordinatelist

textureList 

Usage 

member( whichMember ).model ( whichModel). shader( whichShader ). texture Li st 
member! whichMember ).model ( whichModel ).shader( whichShader ).texture Li st[ index ] 

Description 

3D shader property; determines the list of textures applied to the shader. A shader can have up to 
8 layers of textures. When tested, this property returns a linear list of texture objects. When set 
without specifying an index, this property specifies the texture object to be applied to all layers. 
Setting the textureLi st property to VOID disables texturing for all layers. The default value 
is VOID. 

To test or set the texture object for a specific texture layer, include an index value. 

Example 

This statement sets the 3rd texture layer of the shader named “WallSurface” to the texture named 
“BluePaint” in the cast member named “Room”: 

member( 3) .model("Car").shader!"WallSurface").textureList[3] = \ 
member!"Room").texture!"B1uePaint")

textureMember 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember ).textureMember 

Description 

3D cast member property; indicates the name of the bitmap cast member used as the source of 
the default texture for the 3D cast member. 

The 3D cast members textureType property must be set to #member for the textureMember 
property to be effective. 

Example 

The following statement sets the textureMember property of the cast member named YardScene 
to "Fence". If the textureType property of YardScene is set to #member, the cast member named 
Fence will be the source bitmap for the default texture in YardScene. 

member("YardScene").textureMember = "Fence"

member!whf chCastmember) .model (whi chModel) . shader. textureMode 
member ( whi chCastmember) .model (whi chModel) .shaderl_ist{[index]}.\ 
textureMode 

Description 

3D #standard shader property; specifies how the first texture layer is mapped onto the surface of 
the model. Use the textureModeLi st property to specify textures for layers other than the first 
layer. This property is ignored if the #toon modifier is applied to the model resource. 

The possible values of this property are #none, #wrapPl anar, #wrapCyl i ndri cal, 

#wrapSpheri cal, #ref 1 ecti on, #di ft use Li ght, and #specul arLi ght. For descriptions of 
these terms, see textureModeLi st. 

Example 

This statement sets the value of the textureMode property of the first texture layer of the shader 
of the model named Ball to #wrapSpheri cal:

member! whichCastmember) .model( whichModel) .shader.textureModeList 
member! whichCastmember) .model (whichModel) .shader. 
textureModeList[ textureLayerndex ] 

Description 

3D standard shader property; allows you to change how a textureLayer is mapped onto the 
surface of a model. This property is ignored if the #toon modifier is applied to the model 
resource. Possible values are as follows: 

• #none uses the texture coordinate values originally defined for the model resource. This setting 
disables wrapTransform and wrapTransformLi stltextureLayerlndex]. 

• #wrapPlanar wraps the texture on the model surface as though it were being projected from 
an overhead projector. The shader’s wrapTransformLi stltextureLayerlndex] is applied to 
the mapping space before the texture coordinates are generated in model space. With an 
identity wrapT ransformLi stftextureLayerlndex] (the default), the planar mapping is 
oriented such that the texture is extruded along the Z axis with the texture s up direction along 
the Y axis. 


textureModeList 1021 



• #wrapCyl i ndri cal wraps the texture around the surface as though the surface were placed in 
the middle of the texture and then the texture were rolled around the surface to form a 
cylinder. The wrapTransformLi st[textureLayerIndex] is applied to the mapping space 
before the texture coordinates are generated in model space. With an identity 
wrapTransformLi stEtextureLayerlndex] (the default), the cylindrical mapping is oriented 
such that the texture is wrapped from the -Y axis, starting at the left edge of the texture, toward 
the +X axis, around the Z axis. The up direction of the texture is toward the +Z axis. 

• #w r a p S p h e r i c a 1 wraps the texture around the surface as though the surface were placed in the 
middle of the texture and then all four corners of the texture were pulled up to meet at the top. 
The wrapTransformLi st [textureLayer Index] is applied to the mapping space before the 
texture coordinates are generated in model space. With an identity 

wrapTransformLi st [textureLayer Index], the spherical mapping is located at the model 
space origin and oriented such that the texture is wrapped from the -Y axis, starting at the left 
edge of the texture, toward the +X axis, around the Z axis. The up direction of the texture is 
toward the +Z axis. 

• #ref 1 ecti on is similar to #wrapSpheri cal except that the new texture coordinates are 
continuously reprojected onto the surface from a fixed orientation. When the model rotates, 
the texture coordinates will not rotate with it. Simulates light reflected on an object by its 
environment. This setting disables wrapTransform. 

• #di ffuseLi ght generates diffuse light mapping texture coordinate values, one per vertex, and 
stores the results in the referenced mesh. This setting disables wrapTransform. 

• #specularLight generates specular light mapping texture coordinate values, one per vertex, 
and stores the results in the referenced mesh. This setting disables wrapT ransform. 

Example 

In this example, a shader is set up to simulate a reflective garden ball. The shader's first 
textureLayer is set to a spherical mapping and the third textureLayer is set to use a #refection style 
mapping. The shader’s textureList[3] entry will appear to reflected from the environment onto all 
models which use this shader. 

member("scene").shader!"GardenBal1).textureList[1] = \

textureRenderFormat 

Usage 

getRenderServicesO. textureRenderFormat 

Description 

3D rendererServi ces property; allows you to get or set the default bit format used by all 
textures in all 3d cast members. Use a texture's texture.RenderFormat property to override this 
setting for specific textures only. Smaller sized bit formats (i.e 16 bit variants such as #rgba5551) 
use less hardware accelerator video ram, allowing you to make use of more textures before being 
forced to switch to software rendering. Larger sized bit formats (i.e. 32 bit variants such as 
#rgba8888) generally look better. In order to use alpha transparency in a texture, the last bit must 
be nonzero. In order to get smooth transparency gradations the alpha channel must have more 
than 1 bit of precision. 

Each pixel formats has four digits, with each digit indicating the degree of precision for red, green, 
blue, and alpha. The value you choose determines the accuracy of the color fidelity (precision of 
the alpha channel) and the amount of memory used by the hardware texture buffer. You can 
choose a value that improves color fidelity or a value that allows you to fit more textures on the 
card. You can fit twice as many 16-bit textures as 32-bit textures in the same space. If a movie uses 
more textures than fit on a card at a the same time, Director switches to (/software rendering. 

You can specify any of the following values for textureRenderFormat: 

• #rgba8888: 32 bit color mode with 8 bits each for red, green, blue, and alpha 

• #rgba8880: same as above, with no alpha value 

• #rgba5650: 16-bit color mode with no alpha; 5 bits for red, 6 for green, 5 for blue 

• #rgba5550: 16-bit color mode with no alpha; 5 bits each for red, green, and blue, with no 
alpha measure 

• #rgba5551: 16-bit color mode with 5 bits each for red, green, and blue; 1 bit for alpha 

• #rgba4444: 16-bit color mode with 4 bits each for red, green, blue, and alpha 
The default value is #rgba5551. 

Example 

The following statement sets the global textureRenderFormat for the 3D member to 
#rgba8888. Each texture in this movie will be rendered in 32-bit color unless its 
texture. renderFormat property is set to a value other than #defaul t. 

getRendererServices().textureRenderFormat = #rgba8888

member( whichCastmember). shader (whichShader) .textureRepeat 
member( whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel ).shader.texture Repeat 
member( whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel) ,shaderList{[index]}.\ 
textureRepeat 

Description 

3D //standard shader property; controls the texture clamping behavior of the first texture layer of 
the shader. Use the textureRepeatLi st property to control this property for texture layers other 
than the first layer. 

When textureRepeat is set to TRUE and the value of the x and/or y components of 

shader Reference. textureTransform. scale is less than 1, the texture is tiled (repeated) across 

the surface of the model. 

When textureRepeat is set to FALSE, the texture will not tile. If the value of the x and/or y 
components of shader Reference. textureTransform. scale is less than 1, any area of the 
model not covered by the texture will be black. If the value of the x and/or y components of 
shader Reference. textureT ra ns form, seal e is greater than 1, the texture is cropped as it 
extends past the texture coordinate range. 

The default value of this property is TRUE. This property is always TRUE when using the 
//software Tenderer. 

Example 

The following statement sets the textureRepeat property of the first shader used by the model 
named gbCyl3 to TRUE. The first texture in that shader will tile if the value of the x or y 
component ofits textureTransform or textureTransformLi st property is less than 1. 

member("scene").model("gbCyl3").shader.textureRepeat = TRUE

1024 Chapter 14: Properties 



Description 

3D standard shader property; allows you to get or set the texture clamping behavior of any texture 
layer. When TRUE, the default, the texture in textureLayerlndex can be tiled (repeated) several 
times across model surfaces. This can be accomplished by setting 

shader Reference. textureT rans form [textureLayerlndex], scale to be less than 1 in x or y. 

When this value is set to FALSE, the texture will apply to a smaller portion of model surfaces, 
rather than tile across those surfaces, when the 

shader Reference. textureT rans form [textureLayerlndex], scale is less than 1 in x or y. 
Think of it as shrinking the source image within the frame of the original image and filling in 
black around the gap. Similarly, if 

shader Reference. textureT ra ns form[ texture Layer Index]. seal e is set to be greater than 1 
in x or y, the image will be cropped as the border of the texture is extended past the texture 
coordinate range. 

Example 

The following code will textureMap a sphere entirely with a granite texture repeated 4 times 
across the surface, and a logo image which covers just 1/4 of the surface. 

m = member(2).model("mySphere") 

f = member/2).newTexturet"granite", //f romCastmember, \ 
member/"granite")) 

g = member/2).newTexturet"1ogo", #fromCastmember, member/”1ogo")) 

s = member/2). newShader/"s", //standard) 

s. textureList[1] = g 

s . textureList[2] = f 

s.textureRepeatList[2] = false 

s.textureRepeatList[1] = true 

s.textureT ransformList[l].scale(0.5,0.5,1.0) 

s.textureTransformList[2].scale(0.5,0.5,1.0) 

s . textureModeLi s t [ 2 ] = //wrapPlanar

textureT ransform 

Description 

3D //standard shader property; provides access to a transform which modifies the texture 
coordinate mapping of the first texture layer of the shader. Manipulate this transform to tile, 
rotate, or translate the texture before applying it to the surface of the model. The texture itself 
remains unaffected; the transform merely modifies how the shader applies the texture. The 
textureTransform property is applied to all texture coordinates regardless of the textureMode 
property setting. This is the last modification of the texture coordinates before they are sent to the 
Tenderer. The textureTransform property is a matrix that operates on the texture in 
texturelmage space. Texturelmage space is defined to exist only on the X,Y plane. 


textureT ransform 1025 



To tile the image twice along its horizontal axis, use 

shader Reference. textureT rans form.scaled).5, 1.0, 1.0). Scaling on the Z axis 
is ignored. 

To offset the image by poi nt(x0ffset,y0ffset), use 

shader Reference. textureT ransform.transl ate( xOff set ,y Off set ,0.0). Translating by 
integers when the shader’s textureRepeat property is TRUE will have no effect, because the width 
and height of the texture will be valued between 0.0 and 1.0 in that case. 

To apply a rotation to a texture layer, use 

shader Reference. textureT ransform.rotate(0,0,angle). Rotations around the Z axis are 
rotated around the (0,0) 2d image point, which maps to the upper left corner of the texture. 
Rotations about the X and Y axes are ignored. 

Just as with a model's transform, textureTransform modifications are layerable. To rotate the 
texture about a point(xOffset,yOffset) instead of point(0,0), first translate to point(0 - xOffset, 

0 - yOffset), then rotate, then translate to point(xOffset, yOffset). The textureT ransform is 
similar to the shader’s wrapT ransform property with the following exceptions. It is applied in 2d 
image space rather than 3d world space. As a result, only rotations about the Z axis and 
translations and scales on X and Y axes are effective. The transform is applied regardless of the 
shaderReference. textureMode setting. The wrapT ransform, by comparison, is only effective 
when the textureMode is #wrapPl anar, #wrapCyl i ndri cal, or #wrapSpheri cal. 

Example 

This statement shows the textureT ransform of the first texture in the first shader used by the 
model gbCyl3: 

put member!"Scene").model("gbCyl3").shader.textureTransform 
-- transform!1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000,0.0000, 0.0000, 1.0000, \ 

0 . 0000 , 0 . 0000 , 0 . 0000 , 0 . 0000 , 1 . 0000 , 0 . 0000 , 0 . 0000 , 0 . 0000 , \ 

0 . 0000 , 1 . 0000 ) 

The following statement halves the height and width of the first texture used by the shader named 
gbCyl3. If the textureRepeat property of gbCyl3 is set to TRUE, four copies of the texture will be 
tiled across the shader. 

member("Scene").shader("gbCyl3").textureTransform.seale = \ 
vector(0.5, 0.5, 1) 

This statement rotates the first texture used by the shader gbCyl3 by 90° from vector(0, 0, 0): 

member!"Scene").shader!"gbCyl3").textureTransform.rotation = \ 
vector(0, 0, 90)

1026 Chapter 14: Properties 



Description 

3D standard shader property; this property provides access to a transform which modifies the 
texture coordinate mapping of a texture layer. Manipulate this transform to tile, rotate, or 
translate a texture image before applying it to the surface of models. The texture itself remains 
unaffected, the transform merely modifies how the shader applies the texture. 

To tile the image twice along its horizontal axis, use 

textureT ransformLi st[whi chTextureLayer]. seal e( 0.5 , 1.0, 1.0). Scales in Z will be 
ignored since images are 2D in nature. Care must be taken to avoid 0.0 scales (even in Z), as that 
will negate the effect of the entire texture. 

To offset the image by point(xOffset,yOffset), use 

textureT ransformList[whichTextureLayer].tran siate(xOffset,yOffset,0.0). 
Translating by integers when that texture layer’s textureRepeat property is TRUE will have no 
effect, because the width and height of the texture will be valued between 0.0 and 1.0 in that case. 

To apply a rotation to a texture layer, use 

textureT ransformLi st[whi chTextureLayer] ,rotate(0,0, angle). Rotations around the Z 
axis are rotated around the (0,0) 2D image point, which maps to the upper left corner of the 
texture. Rotations about X and Y will be ignored since images are 2D by nature. 

Just as with a model’s transform, textureTransform modifications are layerable. To rotate the 
image about a point(xOffset,yOffset) instead of point(0,0), first translate to point(0 - xOffset, 

0 - yOffset), then rotate, then translate to point(xOffset, yOffset). 

The textureT ransformLi st is similar to the shader wrapTransformLi st property with the 
following exceptions. 

It is applied in 2D image space rather than 3D world space. As a result, only rotations in Z, and 
translations and scales in X and Y, are effective. 

The transform is applied regardless of the shader Reference. textureModeLi st[i ndex] setting. 
The wrapTransform, by comparison, is only effective when the textureMode is #wrapPl anar, 
#wrapCyl indrical, or #wrapSpherical. 

Example 

This statement shows the textureTransform of the third texture in the first shader used by the 
model gbCyl3: 

put member!"scene").model("gbCyl3").shader.textureTransformList[3] 

-- transform!1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 1.0000, \ 

0 . 0000 , 0 . 0000 , 0 . 0000 , 0 . 0000 , 1 . 0000 , 0 . 0000 , 0 . 0000 , 0 . 0000 , \ 

0 . 0000 , 1 . 0000 ) 

The following statement halves the height and width of the fifth texture used by the shader 
gbCyB. If the textureRepeatLi s t C 5 ] value of gbCyl3 is set to TRUE, four copies of the texture 
will be tiled across the shader. 

member!"scene").shader!”gbCyl3").textureT ransformList[5],scale = \ 
vector(0.5, 0.5, 1) 

This statement rotates the fourth texture used by the shader gbCyl3 by 90° from vector(0, 0, 0): 

member!"scene").shader!"gbCyl3").textureTransformList[4],rotation \ 

= vector(0, 0, 90) 


textureT ransformUst 1027 



These statements rotate the third texture used by the shader gbCyl3 by 90x around its center, 
assuming that textureList[3] is a 128x128 sized texture: 

s = member!"scene").shader("gbCyl3") 
s.textureT ransformList[3].translate!-64,-64,0) 
s . textureTransformList[3].rotate! 0,0,90) 
s.textureTransformList[3].translate!64,64,0) 

textureType 

Usage 

member! uhichCastmember) .textureType 

Description 

3D texture property; allows you to get or set the texture type for the default texture. Possible 
values are as follows: 

• #none specifies that there is no texture type. 

• #defaul t uses the texture from the original shader as the texture. 

• //member uses the image from the specified cast member as the texture. 

The default value for this property is //defaul t. You must specify //member for this property in 
order to use the textureMember property. 

Example 

The following statement sets the textureType property of the cast member Scene to //member, 
member!"Scene").textureType = //member 

This makes it possible use a bitmap cast member as the source of the default texture by setting the 
textureMember property. The bitmap cast member is named “grass”. 

member!"Scene").textureMember = "grass"

toon (modifier) 

Usage 

member( uhichCastmember ).model ( whichModel) .toon .toonModifierProperty 

Description 

3D modifier; once you have added the #toon modifier to a model you can get and set the #toon 
modifier properties. 

The toon modifier draws a model using only a handful of colors, and resulting in a cartoon style 
of rendering of the model’s surface. When the #toon modifier is applied, the model's shader 
texture, refl ecti onMap, di ffuseLi ghtMap, specul arLi ghtMap, and gl ossMap properties 
are ignored. 

When the #toon modifier is used in conjunction with the #i n ke r modifier, the rendered effect is 
cumulative and varies depending on which modifier was first applied. The list of modifiers 
returned by the modifier property will list #inker or #toon (whichever was added first), but not 
both. The toon modifier can not be used in conjunction with the #sds modifier. 

The #toon modifier has the following properties: 

Note: For more detailed information about the following properties see the individual property 
entries. 

• styl e allows you to get or set the style applied to color transitions. The following are the 
possible values: 

#toon gives sharp transitions between available colors. 

#gradi ent gives smooth transitions between available colors. 

#bl ackAndWhi te gives sharp transition between black and white. 

• col orSteps allows you to get or set the number of different colors used for lighting 
calculations. When setting this value it is rounded down to nearest power of 2. Allowed values 
are 2, 4, 8, and 16. The default is 2. 

• shadowPercentage allows you to get or set the percentage of the colors (col orSteps) defined 
for lighting used to render the shadowed portion of the model’s surface. Possible values range 
from 0 to 100. The default is 50. 

• shadowStrength allows you to get or set the level of darkness applied to the shadowed portion 
of the model’s surface. Possible values are any non-negative floating-point number. The default 
value is 1.0. 

• hi ghl i ghtPercentage allows you to get or set the percentage of the colors defined for 
lighting (col orSteps) used to render the highlighted portion of the model’s surface. Possible 
values range from 0 to 100. The default is 50. 

• hi ghl i ghtStrength allows you to get or set the level of brightness applied to the highlighted 
portion of the model’s surface. Possible values are any non-negative floating-point number. 
The default value is 1.0. 


1034 Chapter 14: Properties 



• 1 i neCol or allows you to get or set the color of lines drawn by the inker. Possible values are any 
valid Lingo color object. The default value is rgb (0 , 0 , 0), which is black. 

• creases allows you to get or set whether lines are drawn in creases. This is a Boolean value; the 
default value is True. 

• creaseAngl e, if creases is set to TRUE, allows you to get or set how sensitive the line drawing 
function of the toon modifier is to the presence of creases. 

• boundary allows you to get or set whether lines are drawn around the boundary of the surface. 
This is a Boolean value; the default value is True. 

• lineOffset allows you to get or set where lines are drawn relative to the shaded surface and 
the camera. Negative lines move lines toward the camera. Positive values move lines away from 
the camera. Possible values are floating-point numbers from -100.0 to 100.0. The default value 
is -2.0. 

• useLi neOffset allows you to get or set whether 1 i neOffset is on or off. This is a Boolean 
value; the default value is False. 

• si 1 houettes allows you to get or set whether lines are drawn to define the edges along the 
border of a model, outlining its shape. This is a Boolean value; the default value is T rue.

transform (property) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .node( whichNode) .transform 

member( whichCastmember) .node( whichNode) .transform. transform\ 

Property 

member ( whi chCastmember) .model (.whi chModel ) .bonesPlayer.X 
bonetbonelD],transform 

member( whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel) .bonesPlayer.X 
bone[boneID].transform. transformProperty 

Description 

3D property and command; allows you to get or set the transform associated with a particular 
node or a specific bone within a model using the bonesPl ayer modifier. As a command, 
transform provides access to the various commands and properties of the transform object. A 
node can be a camera, group, light or model object. 

For node objects, this property defaults to the identity transform. A node’s transform defines the 
position, rotation and scale of the node relative to is parent object. If a node’s parent is the World 
group object, then the transform property of the node has the same value as is returned by the 
getWorl dTransform() command. 


transform (property) 1045 



For bones within models using the bonesPl ayer modifier, this property defaults in value to the 
transform assigned to the bone upon creation of the model file. The transform of a bone 
represents the bone’s rotation relative to its parent bone and its position relative to its original 
joint position. The original joint position is determine upon creation of the model file. 

You can use the following transform commands and properties with the transform property of 
node objects: 

Note: This section only contains summaries, see the individual entries for more detailed information. 

• preScale applies scaling before the current positional, rotational, and scale offsets held by 
the transform. 

• preTransl ate applies a translation before the current positional, rotational, and scale offsets 
held by the transform. 

• preRotate applies a rotation before the current positional, rotational, and scale offsets held by 
the transform. 

• scale (command) applies scaling after the current positional, rotational, and scale offsets held 
by the transform. 

• scale (transform) allows you to get or set the degree of scaling of the transform. 

• transl ate applies a translation after the current positional, rotational, and scale offsets held 
by the transform. 

• rotate applies a rotation after the current positional, rotational, and scale offsets held by 
the transform. 

• position (transform) allows you to get or set the positional offset of the transform. 

• rotation (transform) allows you to get or set the rotational offset of the transform. 

If you want to modify the transform property of a bone within a model, then you must store a 
copy of the original transform of the bone, modify the stored copy using the above commands 
and properties, then reset the bone’s transform property so that it is equal to the modified 
transform. For example: 

t = member(“character”).model(“biped”).bonesPlayer.bone[38].\ 
transform.duplicate() 
t.translate(25,0,-3) 

member!“character”).model(“biped”).bonesPlayer.bone[38].\ 
transform = t 

Parameters 

None. 

Example 

This Lingo shows the transform of the model box, followed by the position and rotation 
properties of the transform: 

put member("3d world").model("box").transform 
-- transform(l.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000, \

Description 

Transition cast member property; determines a transition’s type, which is specified as a 
number. The possible values are the same as the codes assigned to transitions for the 
puppetTransition command. 

Example 

This statement sets the type of transition cast member 3 to 51, which is a pixel dissolve 
cast member: 

member(3).transitionType = 51

translation 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef. transl ati on 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. transl ati on; 

Description 

QuickTime cast member and sprite property; controls the offset of a QuickTime sprites image 
within the sprites bounding box. 

This offset is expressed in relation to the sprite’s default location as set by its center 
property. When center is set to TRUE, the sprite is offset relative to the center of the bounding 
rectangle; when center is set to FALSE, the sprite is offset relative to the upper left corner of the 
bounding rectangle. 

The offset, specified in pixels as positive or negative integers, is set as a Director list: [xTrans , 
yTrans]. The xTrans parameter specifies the horizontal offset from the sprites default location; 
the yTrans parameter specifies the vertical offset. The default setting is [0,0]. 

When the sprite’s crop property is set to TRUE, the transl ati on property can be used to mask 
portions of the QuickTime movie by moving them outside the bounding rectangle. When the 
crop property is set to FALSE, the transl ati on property is ignored, and the sprite is always 
positioned at the upper left corner of the sprite’s rectangle. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

The following frame script assumes that the center property of the cast member of a 320-pixel- 
wide QuickTime sprite in channel 5 is set to FALSE, and its crop property is set to TRUE. It keeps 
the playhead in the current frame until the movie's horizontal translation point has moved to the 
right edge of the sprite, in 10-pixel increments. This has a wipe right effect, moving the sprite out 
of view to the right. When the sprite is out of view, the playhead continues to the next frame. 

-- Lingo syntax 
on exitFrame 

horizontalPosition = sprite(5).translation[1] 
if horizontalPosition < 320 then

member(w/?7 chCastmember) .model (whi chModel) .shader.transparent 
member(iW77 chCastmember) .model (whi chModel) .shaderListX 
VshaderLi stlndex~\ .transparent 

Description 

3D standard shader property; lets you get or set whether a model is blended using alpha 
values (TRUE) or is rendered as opaque (FALSE). The default value for this property is TRUE 
(alpha-blended). 

The functionality of shader.blend is dependent upon this property. 

All shaders have access to the ((standard shader properties; in addition to these standard shader 
properties shaders of the types #engraver, #newspri nt, and ((painter have properties unique to 
their type. For more information, see the newShader. 

Example 

The following statement causes the model Pluto to be rendered opaque. The setting of the blend 
property for the model’s shader will have no effect. 

member("scene").model("PIuto").shader.transparent = FALSE

triggerCallback 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri teObjRef. tri ggerCallback 

// JavaScript syntax 

spri teObjRef. tri ggerCallback; 

Description 

QuickTime VR sprite property; contains the name of the handler that runs when the user clicks a 
hotspot in a QuickTime VR movie. The handler is sent two arguments: the me parameter and the 
ID of the hotspot that the user clicked. 

The value that the handler returns determines how the movie processes the hotspot. If the handler 
returns ((conti nue, the QuickTime VR sprite continues to process the hotspot normally. If the 
handler returns ((cancel , the default behavior for the hotspot is canceled. 

Set this property to 0 to clear the callback. 

The QuickTime VR sprite receives the message first. 

To avoid a decrease in performance, set the triggerCallback property only when necessary. 
This property can be tested and set. 


triggerCallback 1049 



Example 

The following statement sets the callback handler for a QuickTime VR sprite to the handler 
named MyHotSpotCal 1 back when the playhead first enters the sprite span. Every time that 
hotspot is triggered, the MyHotSpotCal 1 back handler is executed. When the playhead leaves the 
sprite span, the callback is canceled. 

-- Lingo syntax

Resource) .tunnelDepth 

Description 

A 3D extruder model resource property, as well as a text cast member property. Using this 
property allows you to get or set the extrusion depth (the distance between the front and back 
faces) of a 3D text model resource Possible values are floating point numbers between 1.0 and 
100.0. The default value is 50.0. 

It is recommended that you see extrudeToMember entry for more information about working 
with extruder model resources and text cast members. 

Example 

In this example, the cast member logo is a text cast member. The following statement sets the 
tunnelDepth of logo to 5. When logo is displayed in 3D mode, its letters will be very shallow. 

member("1ogo").tunnel Depth = 5 

In this example, the model resource of the model Slogan is extruded text. The following 
statement sets the tunnel Depth of Slogan's model resource to 1000. Slogan’s letters will be 
extremely deep. 

member("scene").model("SIogan").resource.tunnel Depth = 1000

tweenMode 


Usage 

member (whi chCastmember) .model Resource( whichModelResource) .tweenMode 
model ResourceObjectReference. tweenMode 

Description 

3D particle property; allows you to get or set whether the color of a particle varies according to it’s 
speed or age. The tweenMode property can have the following values: 

• #vel oci ty alters the color of the particle between col or Range, start and color Range.end 
based on the velocity of the particle. 

• #a ge alters the color of the particle by linearly interpolating the color between 

col or Range, start and color Range.end over the lifetime of the particle. This is the default 
setting for this property. 

Example 

In this example, ThermoSystem is a model resource of the type #particle. This statement sets the 
ThermoSystem’s tweenMode to #velocity, so its slower particles will not reach the color specified 
by colorRange.end, while its faster particles will: 

member(8,2).model Resource!"thermoSystem").tweenMode = \ 

#velocitytype (light) 

type (light) 

Usage 

member ( whichCastmember) . 1 i ght( whichLight) .type 

Description 

3D light property; the light type of the referenced light. This property’s possible values are 
as follows: 

• #ambi ent lights of this type cast their light evenly on all surfaces. The intensity of ambient 
lights is not affected by distance from the light source. 

• #di recti onal lights appear to shine in a particular direction, but are not as focused as lights 
of type #spot. The intensity of directional lights decreases with distance from the light source. 

• #poi nt lights shine in all directions from a specific location in the 3D world. The effect is 
similar to a bare light bulb hanging in a room. The intensity of point lights decreases with 
distance from the light source. 

• #spot Lights of this type cast their light from a particular point and within the cone defined by 
the light’s forward direction and spotAngl e property. The intensity of spot lights declines with 
distance from the light source using the values defined in the light’s attenuation property. 

Example 

The following statement displays the type property of the light named MainLight: 

put member( "3D" ).motion("MainLight").type 
-- #spot

cast members. 


For movies created in Director 5 and 6, the type property returns #f i el d for field cast members 
and #ri chText for text cast members. Fiowever, field cast members originally created in Director 
4 return #text for the member type, providing backward compatibility for movies that were 
created in Director 4.

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement clears sprite channel 1 when issued during a Score recording session: 
sprite(1).type = 0 

type (texture) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .shader( whichShader ).type 

Description 

3D texture property; the texture type of the referenced texture object. This property’s possible 
values are: 

• #f romCastMember indicates that this is texture was created from a Director cast member 
supporting the image property using the newTexture command. 

• #fromlmage0bject indicates that this is texture was created from an image object using the 
newTexture command. 

• #importedFromFi 1 e indicates that this texture was created external to Director and created 
upon file import or cast member loading. 

Example 

This statement shows that the texture used by the shader for the model named Pluto was created 
from an image object: 

put member("scene").model("Pluto").shader.texture.type 
-- #fromlmageObject

type (Window) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
windowObjRef. type 

// JavaScript syntax 
windowObjRef. type; 

Description 

Window property; specifies the window type. Read/write. 

If the type property is set, all properties pertaining to the new window are set accordingly. 
This property can be one of the following values: 


Property Description 

//document Specifies that the window will appear with a standard title bar, a close box, a minimize 
box, and a maximize box. These types of windows can be moved. 

//tool Specifies that the window will appear with a shorter title bar and only a small close box in 

the upper right corner. These types of windows no longer receive activate or deactivate 
events, because //tool windows are always active. These types of windows will always 
later with each other, and will always appear on top of //document windows. 

//dialog Specifies that the window will appear with a standard title bar, a close box, and no icon. 

These types of windows are modal, and will always appear on top of all other windows. 


These properties can also be accessed by using the Movie object’s displayTemplate property. 

Window behaviors also depend on the values of the type property and the Movie object’s 

docki ngEnabl ed property 

• If docki ngEnabl ed is TRUE and type is set to //document, the MLAW will look and act like a 
document window in Director. The window will appear in the “view port” area and be 
dockable with the Stage, Score, and Cast windows, media editors, and message windows. 
However, the window will not be able to group with any of these windows. 

• If docki ngEnabl ed is TRUE and type is set to //tool , the MIAW will look and act like a tool 
window in Director. The window will be able to group with all tool windows except the 
Property inspector and the Tool palette. 

• If docki ngEnabl ed is TRUE and type is set to // ful 1 screen or #di al og, the type is ignored 
and the window will be an authoring window. 

Example 

This statement sets the type of the window named Planets to //tool. 

-- Lingo syntax 

window("PIanets").type = //tool 

// JavaScript syntax 

window("PIanets").type = "tool":

updateLock 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.updateLock 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.updateLock; 

Description 

Movie property; determines whether the Stage is updated during Score recording (FALSE) or 
not (TRUE). Read/write. 

You can keep the Stage display constant during a Score recording session by setting updateLock 
to TRUE before script updates the Score. If updateLock is FALSE, the Stage updates to show a new 
frame each time the frame is entered. 

You can also use updateLock to prevent unintentional Score updating when leavinga frame, such 
as when you temporarily leave a frame to examine properties in another frame. 

Although this property can be used to mask changes to a frame during run time, be aware that 
changes to field cast members appear immediately when the content is modified, unlike changes 
to location or members with other sprites, which are not updated until this property is turned off.

updateMovieEnabled 

Usage 

the updateMovieEnabled 

Description 

System property; specifies whether changes made to the current movie are automatically saved 
(TRUE) or not saved (FALSE, default) when the movie branches to another movie. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement instructs Director to save changes to the current movie whenever the movie 
branches to another movie: 

the updateMovieEnabled = TRUE 


1058 Chapter 14: Properties 



URL 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. URL 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. URL; 

Description 

Cast member property; specifies the URL for Shockwave Audio (SWA) and Flash movie 
cast members. 

For Flash movie members, this property is synonymous with the pathName member property 

The URL property can be tested and set. For SWA members, it can be set only when the SWA 
streaming cast member is stopped. 

Example 

This statement makes a file on an Internet server the URL for SWA cast member Benny 
Goodman: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on mouseDown 

member!"Benny Goodman").URL = \ 

"http: //audi o.macromedi a.com/sampl es/classic.swa" 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function mouseDown!) { 

member!"Benny Goodman").URL = 

"http://audio.macromedia.com/samples/classic.swa" 


useAlpha 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. useAl pha 
imageObjRef. useAl pha 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. useAl pha; 
imageObjRef. useAl pha; 

Description 

Bitmap cast member and image object property; for 32-bit cast members and image objects with 
alpha channel information, determines whether Director uses the alpha information when 
drawing the image onto the Stage (TRUE), or whether Director ignores the alpha information 
when drawing to the Stage (FALSE). 


useAlpha 1059 



Example 


This toggles the alpha channel of cast member “foreground” on and off: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("foreground").useAlpha = not(member("foreground").useAlpha) 

// JavaScript syntax 
switch(member("foreground").useAlpha) { 
case 0: 

member("foreground").useAl pha = 1; 
break; 
case 1: 

member("foreground").useAlpha = 0; 
break; 

1 


useDiff useWithT exture 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .shader( whichShader ).useDi ffuseWithTexture 

Description 

3D standard shader property; allows you to get or set whether the diffuse color is used to 
modulate the texture (TRUE) or not (FALSE). 

When set to TRUE, this property works in conjunction with the bl endFuncti on and 
bl endConstant properties; when bl endFuncti on is set to Addend, the diffuse color is weighed 
with the texture color to determine the final color. For example, if bl endFuncti on is set to 
#blend, and bl endConstant is set to 100.0, the final color is the pure texture color. If we change 
bl endConstant to 0.0, the final color is the diffuse color. If we change bl endConstant to 10.0, 
the final color is 10% texture color, and 90% diffuse color. 

The default value for this property is FALSE. 

All shaders have access to the #standard shader properties; in addition to these standard shader 
properties shaders of the types #engraver, #newspri nt, and # pa i nter have properties unique to 
their type. For more information, see newShader. 

Example 

In this example, the shaderList of the model MysteryBox contains six shaders. Each shader has 
a texture list which contains up to eight textures. The diffuseColor property of the cast member 
(Level2) is set to rgb(255, 0, 0). The bl endFuncti on property of all six shaders is set to #blend, 
and the blendConstant property of all six shaders is set to 80. This statement sets the 
useDi ff useWi thTexture property of all shaders used by MysteryBox to TRUE. A little bit of 
red will be blended into the surface of the model. This property is affected by the settings of the 
bl endFuncti on, bl endFuncti onList, blendSource, blendSourceList, bl endConstant, and 
bl endConstantLi st properties. 

member("Level 2" ).model("MysteryBox").shaderl ist.useDi ffuseWi th\ 

Texture = TRUE

useFastQuads 


Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_movie.useFastQuads 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.useFastQuads; 

Description 

Movie property; determines whether to use faster (TRUE) or slower (FALSE, default) quad 
calculation operations. Read/write. 

When set to TRUE, Director uses a faster, less precise method for calculating quad operations. Fast 
quads calculations are good for simple rotation and skew sprite effects. 

When set to FALSE, Director uses the slower, default quad calculation method that provides more 
visually pleasing results when using quads for distortion and other arbitrary effects. 

Simple sprite rotation and skew operations always use the fast quad calculation method, regardless 
of this setting. Setting useFastQuads to TRUE will not result in an increase in the speed of these 
simple operations. 

Example 

This statement tells Director to use its faster quad calculation code for all quad operations 
in the movie: 

-- Lingo syntax 

_movie.useFastQuads = TRUE 

// JavaScript syntax 
_movie.useFastQuads = true;

Movi e 

useHypertextStyles 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberObjRef .useHypertextStyi es 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. useHypertextStyi es; 

Description 

Text cast member property; controls the display of hypertext links in the text cast member. 

When useHypertextStyi es is TRUE, all links are automatically colored blue with underlines, 
and the pointer (cursor) changes to a pointing finger when it is over a link. 

Setting this property to FALSE turns off the automatic formatting and pointer change. 


useHypertextStyles 1061 



Example 


This behavior toggles the formatting of hypertext on and off in text cast member “myText”: 

--Lingo syntax 
on mouseUp 

member( "myText").usehypertextStyles = \ 
not(member("myText").usehypertextStyles ) 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
functi on mouseUp!) { 

member!"myText").usehypertextStyles = 

!(member!"myText").usehypertextStyles ) 


useLineOffset 

Usage 

member! whi chCastmember) .model (whi chModel ) .toon.useLi neOffset 
member! whichCastmember) .model ( whichModel ). inker.use Li neOffset 

Description 

3D toon and i nker modifier property; indicates whether the modifier’s 1 i neOffset property is 
used by the modifier when it draws lines on the surface of the model. 

The default value of this property is FALSE. 

Example 

The following statement sets the useLi neOffset property of the toon modifier for the model 
named Teapot to FALSE. The toon modifier’s 1 i neOffset property will have no effect. 

member("tp").model("Teapot").toon.useLineOffset = FALSE 

See also 

1ineOffset 

userData 

Usage 

member(whichCastmember) .model (whichModel ).userData 
member! whichCastmember) . 1 i ght! whichLight). userData 
member! whichCastmember) .camera! whichCamera) .userData 
member! whichCastmember) .group! whichCamera) .userData 

Description 

3D property; returns the userData property list of a model, group, camera, or light. The default 
value of this property for an object that was created outside of Director is a list of all the 
properties that were assigned to the model’s userData property in the 3D modeling tool. The 
default value of this property for objects created inside of Director is an empty property list [:], 
unless the object was created using any of the clone commands. If a cloning command was used 
to create the object then the new object’s userData property defaults to a value equal to that of 
the original source object. 


1062 Chapter 14: Properties 



To modify the elements of this list you must use the add Prop and deleteProp commands 
documented in the main Lingo Dictionary. 

Example 

This statement displays the userData property of the model named New Body: 

put member!"Car").model("New Body").userData 
-- [#driver: "Bob", #damage: 34] 

This statement adds the property #health with the value 100 to the userData property list for 
the model named Player: 

member!“scene”).model ( “PIayer” ). userData.addProp(#health, 100) 

userName 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
_player.userName 

// JavaScript syntax 
_player.userName; 

Description 

Player property; a string containing the user name entered when Director was installed. 
Read-only. 

This property is available in the authoring environment only. It could be used in a movie in a 
window (MIAW) tool that is personalized to show the user’s information. 

Example 

The following handler places the user’s name and serial number in a display field when the 
window is opened. (A movie script in the MIAW is a good location for this handler.) 

-- Lingo syntax 
on prepareMovie 

displaystring = _player.userName & RETURN & _player.organizationName \ 

& RETURN & _player.serialNumber 
memberC'User Info").text = di spl ayStri ng 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function prepareMovie!) { 

var displaystring = _player.userName + "\n" + _player.organizationName 
+ "\n" + _player.serialNumber; 
memberC'User Info").text = di spl ayStri ng ;

userName (RealMedia) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. userName 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. userName; 

Description 

RealMedia sprite and cast member property; allows you to set the user name required to access a 
protected RealMedia stream. For security reasons, you cannot use this property to retrieve a 
previously specified user name. If a user name has been set, the value of this property is the string 
"********''. The default value of this property is an empty string, which means no user name has 
been specified. 

Example 

The following examples show that the user name for the RealMedia stream in the cast member 
Real or sprite 2 has been set. 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(2).userName) -- "********" 
put(member("Real").userName) -- "********" 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(sprite(2).userName); // ”********" 

put(member("Real").userName); // "********" 

The following examples show that the user name for the RealMedia stream in the cast member 
Real or sprite 2 has never been set. 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(sprite(2).userName) -- "" 

put(member("Real").userName) -- "" 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(sprite(2).userName); // "" 
put(member("Real").userName); // "" 

The following examples set the user name for the RealMedia stream in the cast member Real and 
sprite 2 to Marcelle. 

-- Lingo syntax 

member("Real").userName = "Marcelle" 
sprite(2).userName = "Marcelle" 

// JavaScript syntax 

member("Real").userName = "Marcelle"; 

sprite(2).userName = "Marcelle";

useT argetFrameRate 

Usage 

sprite( which3dSprite). useTargetFrame Rate 

Description 

3D sprite property; determines whether the target FrameRate property of the sprite is enforced. 
If the useT argetFrameRate property is set to TRUE, the polygon count of the models in the sprite 
are reduced if necessary to achieve the specified frame rate. 

Example 

These statements set the targetFrameRate property of sprite 3 to 45 and enforce the frame rate 
by setting the useTargetFrameRate property of the sprite to TRUE: 

sprite(3).targetFrameRate = 45 
sprite(3).useTargetFrameRate = TRUE 

See also 

ta rgetFrameRate 

vertex 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberObjRef. vertex[ w/?7 chVertexPosi 17 on] 

// JavaScript syntax 

memberObjRef. vertex[w/?7 chVertexPosition ]; 

Description 

Chunk expression; enables direct access to parts of a vertex list of a vector shape cast member. 

Use this chunk expression to avoid parsing different chunks of the vertex list. It’s possible to both 
test and set values of the vertex list using this type of chunk expression. 

Example 

The following code shows how to determine the number of vertex points in a member: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(member("Archie").vertex.count) -- 2 
// JavaScript syntax 

put(member!"Archie").vertex.count); // 2 

To obtain the second vertex for the member, you can use code like this: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(member("Archie").vertex[2]) -- point(66.0000, -5.0000) 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(member("Archie").vertex[2]); // point(66.0000, -5.0000) 

You can also set the value in a control handle: 

-- Lingo syntax 

membert"Archie").vertex[2].hand!el = point(-63.0000, -16.0000) 


vertex 1065 



// JavaScript syntax 

member("Archie").vertex[2].handlel = point(-63.0000, -16.0000); 

See also 

vertexList 

vertexList 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. vertexLi st 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef .vertexLi st; 

Description 

Cast member property; returns a linear list containing property lists, one for each vertex of a 
vector shape. The property list contains the location of the vertex and the control handle. There 
are no control handles if the location is (0,0). 

Each vertex can have two control handles that determine the curve between this vertex and the 
adjacent vertices. In vertexLi st, the coordinates of the control handles for a vertex are kept 
relative to that vertex, rather than absolute in the coordinate system of the shape. If the first 
control handle of a vertex is located 10 pixels to the left of that vertex, its location is stored as 
(-10, 0). Thus, when the location of a vertex is changed with Lingo, the control handles move 
with the vertex and do not need to be updated (unless the user specifically wants to change the 
location or size of the handle). 

When modifying this property, be aware that you must reset the list contents after changing any 
of the values. This is because when you set a variable to the value of the property, you are placing 
a copy of the list, not the list itself, in the variable. To effect a change, use code like this: 

- Get the current property contents 
currVertList = member!1).vertexList 

-- Add 25 pixels to the horizontal and vertical positions of the first vertex 
in the list 

currVertListC1] .vertex = currVertList[1] .vertex + point(25, 25) 

-- Reset the actual property to the newly computed position 
member(1).vertexList = currVertList 

Example 

This statement displays the vertextLi st value for an arched line with two vertices: 

-- Lingo syntax 

put(member!"Archie").vertexList) 

-- [[((vertex: poi nt!-66.0000 , 37.0000), \ 

#handlel: point(-70.0000 , -36.0000), \ 

#handle2: poi nt (-62.0000 , 110.0000)], [((vertex: point(66.0000, -5.0000), \ 
((handl el: poi nt! 121.0000 , 56.0000), (fhandle2: poi nt (11.0000 , -66.0000)]] 

// JavaScript syntax 

put(member!"Archie").vertexList); 

//[[((vertex: poi nt!-66.0000 , 37.0000), (fhandlel: poi nt (-70.0000 , -36.0000), 
((handl e2: poi nt!-62.0000 , 110.0000)], [((vertex: point(66.0000, -5.0000), 
((handl el: poi nt! 121.0000 , 56.0000), #handle2: poi nt (11.0000 , -66.0000)]]

vertexList (mesh generator) 

Usage 

member( whichCastmember ).model Resource( whichModelResource ).vertexList 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model resource whose type is #mesh, allows you to get or set the 
vertexLi st property for the model resource. 

The vertexLi st is a linear list of each vertex used in the mesh. A single vertex may be shared by 
numerous faces of the mesh. You can specify a list of any size for this property, but it will store 
only the number ofitems specified when using the newMesh( ) command to create the #mesh 
model resource. 

Example 

This statement sets the vertexLi st of the model resource named Triangle: 

member("Shapes").model Resource!"Triangle").vertexList = \ 

[vector(0,0,0), vector!20,0,0), vector(20, 20, 0)] 

See also 

newMesh, face, vertices 

vertexList (mesh deform) 

Usage 

member(whichCastmember ).model (whichModel) .meshDeform.meshX 
[ index ].vertexList 

Description 

3D property; when used with a model with the #meshDeform modifier attached, it allows you to 
get or set the vertexLi st property for the specified mesh within the referenced model. 

The vertexLi st is a linear list of each vertex used in the specified mesh. A single vertex may be 
shared by numerous faces of the mesh. 

If a model makes use of the # sds or #1 od modifiers in addition to the #meshDeform modifier, 
then it is important to know that the value of this property will change under the influence of the 
#sds or #1 od modifiers. 

Example 

This statement displays the #meshDeform modifier’s vertexLi st for the first mesh in the model 
named Triangle: 

put member!"Shapes").model("Triangle").meshDeform,mesh[l].vertexList 
-- [vector(0,0,0), vector!20,0,0), vector(20, 20, 0)]

face, vertices, mesh (property) 


vertexList (mesh deform) 1067 




vertices 


Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .model Resource( whichModelResource).\ 
face[ facelndex ].vertices 

Description 

3D face property; when used with a model resource whose type is #mesh, this property allows you 
to get or set which vertices from the resources vertexLi st property to use for the mesh face 
specified by facelndex. 

This property is a linear list of three integers corresponding to the index positions of the three 
vertices, as found in the mesh’s vertexLi st property, that comprise the specified face. 

The vertices must be specified in the list using counterclockwise winding in order to achieve an 
outward pointing surface normal. 

If you make changes to this property or use the generateNormals!) command, you will need to 
call the bu i 1 d () command in order to rebuild the mesh. 

Example 

This example displays the vertexLi st of the mesh model resource named SimpleSquare, then it 
displays the verti ces property for the second face of that mesh: 

put member!"3D").model Resource("SimpleSquare").vertexLi st 
-- [vector! 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000), vector! 0.0000, 5.0000, \ 

0.0000), vector! 5.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000), vector! 5.0000, \ 

5.0000, 0.0000)] 

put member!" 3D").model Resource("SimpleSquare").face[l].vertices

Description 

Digital video cast member property; determines whether the graphic image of the specified digital 
video cast member plays (TRUE or 1) or not (FALSE or 0). 

Only the visual element of the digital video cast member is affected. For example, when video is 
set to FALSE, the digital video’s soundtrack, if present, continues to play. 

Example 

This statement turns off the video associated with the cast member Interview: 
member!"Interview").video = FALSE

video (RealMedia, Windows Media) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef. vi deo 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. vi deo; 

Description 

RealMedia and Windows Media property; allows you to set or get whether the sprite or cast 
member renders video (TRUE or 1) or only plays the sounds (FALSE or 0). Read/write. 

Integer values other than 1 or 0 are treated as TRUE. 

Use this property to suppress the video while playing the audio component of a RealMedia or 
Windows Media cast member, or to toggle the video on and off during playback. 

Example 

The following examples show that the video property for sprite 2 and the cast member Real is set 
to TRUE. 

-- Lingo syntax 
put(sprite(2).video) -- 1 
put(member!"Real").video) -- 1 

// JavaScript syntax 
put(sprite(2).video); // 1 
put(member("Real").video); // 1 

The following examples set the vi deo property to FALSE for the RealMedia video element of 
sprite 2 and the cast member Real. 

-- Lingo syntax 

spri te(2).video = FALSE 

member("Real").video = FALSE 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(2).video = 0 ; 
member("Real").video = 0; 

videoFormat 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax

viewH 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef .vi ewH 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. vi ewH; 

Description 

Cast member and sprite property; controls the horizontal coordinate of a Flash movie and vector 
shape’s view point, specified in pixel units. The values can be floating-point numbers. The default 
value is 0. 

A Flash movie’s view point is set relative to its origin point. 

Setting a positive value for vi ewH shifts the movie to the left inside the sprite; setting a negative 
value shifts the movie to the right. Therefore, changing the vi ewH property can have the effect of 
cropping the movie or even of removing the movie from view entirely. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Note: This property must be set to the default value if the scaleMode property is set to fautoSize, or 
the sprite will not display correctly.

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef .vi ewPoi nt 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. vi ewPoi nt; 

Description 

Cast member property and sprite property; controls the point within a Flash movie or vector 
shape that is displayed at the center of the sprite’s bounding rectangle in pixel units. The values 
are integers. 

Changing the view point of a cast member changes only the view of a movie in the sprite’s 
bounding rectangle, not the location of the sprite on the Stage. The view point is the coordinate 
within a cast member that is displayed at the center of the sprite’s bounding rectangle and is 
always expressed relative to the movie’s origin (as set by the ori gi nPoi nt, ori gi nH, and ori gi nV 
properties). For example, if you set a Flash movie’s view point at point (100,100), the center of 
the sprite is the point within the Flash movie that is 100 Flash movie pixel units to the right 
and 100 Flash movie pixel units down from the origin point, regardless of where you move the 
origin point. 

The vi ewPoi nt property is specified as a Director point value: for example, point (100,200). 
Setting a Flash movie’s view point with the vi ewPoi nt property is the same as setting the vi ewH 
and vi ewV properties separately. For example, setting the vi ewPoi nt property to point (50,75) is 
the same as setting the vi ewH property to 50 and the vi ewV property to 75. 


viewpoint 1071 




Director point values specified for the viewpoint property are restricted to integers, whereas 
vi ewH and vi ewV can be specified with floating-point numbers. When you test the vi ewPoi nt 
property, the point values are truncated to integers. As a general guideline, use the vi ewH and 
vi ewV properties for precision; use the ori gi nPoi nt property for speed and convenience. 

This property can be tested and set. The default value is point (0,0). 

Note: This property must be set to the default value if the scaleMode property is set to fautoSize, or 
the sprite will not display correctly. 

Example 

This handler makes a specified Flash movie sprite move down and to the right in increments of 
five Flash movie pixel units: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on panAcross(whichSprite) 
repeat with i = 1 to 10 

sprite(whichSprite).viewPoint = sprite(whichSprite).vi ewPoi nt + \ 
point(i * -5, i * -5) 

_movi e.updateStageO 
end repeat 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function panAcross(whichSprite) { 
var i = 1; 
whiled < 11) { 

sprite(whichSprite).viewPoint = sprite(whichSprite).viewPoint + 
point(i * -5, i * -5); 

_movi e.updateStageO; 
i++

viewScale 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 

memberOrSpriteObjRef .vi ewScal e 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpri teObjRef. vi ewScal e; 

Description 

Cast member property and sprite property; sets the overall amount to scale the view of a Flash 
movie or vector shape sprite within the sprite’s bounding rectangle. You specify the amount as a 
percentage using a floating-point number. The default value is 100. 

The sprite rectangle itself is not scaled; only the view of the cast member within the rectangle is 
scaled. Setting the vi ewScal e property of a sprite is like choosing a lens for a camera. As the 
vi ewScal e value decreases, the apparent size of the movie within the sprite increases, and vice 
versa. For example, setting vi ewScal e to 200% means the view inside the sprite will show twice 
the area it once did, and the cast member inside the sprite will appear at half its original size. 


1072 Chapter 14: Properties 



One significant difference between the vi ewScal e and seal e properties is that vi ewScal e 
always scales from the center of the sprite’s bounding rectangle, whereas scale scales from a point 
determined by the Flash movies ori gi nMode property. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Note: This property must be set to the default value if the scaleMode property is set to fautoSize, or 
the sprite will not display correctly. 

Example 

This sprite script sets up a Flash movie sprite and doubles its view scale: 

-- Lingo syntax 
property spriteNum 

on beginSprite me 

sprite(spriteNum).viewScale = 200 
end 

// JavaScript syntax 
function beginSprite!) { 

sprite(this.spriteNum).viewScale = 200;

viewV 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef .viewV 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberOrSpriteObjRef .vi ewV; 

Description 

Cast member and sprite property; controls the vertical coordinate of a Flash movie and vector 
shape’s view point, specified in pixel units. The values can be floating-point numbers. The default 
value is 0. 

A Flash movie’s view point is set relative to its origin point. 

Setting a positive value for vi ewV shifts the movie up inside the sprite; setting a negative value 
shifts the movie down. Therefore, changing the vi ewV property can have the effect of cropping 
the movie or even of removing the movie from view entirely. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Note: This property must be set to the default value if the scaleMode property is set to fautoSize, or 
the sprite will not display correctly. 


viewV 1073 




Example 


This handler accepts a sprite reference as a parameter and moves the view of a Flash movie sprite 
from the top to the bottom within the sprite’s bounding: rectangle: 

-- Lingo syntax 
on panDownlwhichSprite) 

repeat with i = 120 down to -120 
sprite(whichSprite).viewV = i 
_movi e.updateStageO

visible (sprite) 

Usage 

sprite( whichSprite) .vi si bl e 
the visible of sprite whichSprite 

Description 

Sprite property; determines whether the sprite specified by whichSpri te is visible (TRUE) or not 
(FALSE). This property affects all sprites in the channel, regardless of their position in the Score. 

Note: Setting the vi si bl e property of a sprite channel to FALSE makes the sprite invisible and 
prevents only the mouse-related events from being sent to that channel. The begi nSpri te, endSpri te, 
prepare Frame, enter Frame, and exi t Frame events continue to be sent regardless of the sprite's 
visibility setting. Clicking the Mute button on that channel in the Score, however, will set the vi si bl e 
property to FALSE and prevent all events from being sent to that channel. Muting disables a channel, 
while setting a sprite's visible property to FALSE merely affects a graphic property. 

This property can be tested and set. If set to FALSE, this property will not automatically reset to 
TRUE when the sprite ends. You must set the visible property of the sprite to TRUE in order to 
see any other members using that channel. 

Example 

This statement makes sprite 8 visible: 
sprite(8) .visible = TRUE 

visibility 

Usage 

member (whi chCastmember) .model ( whichModel) .vi si bi 1 i ty 
model Object Reference. vi si bi 1 i ty 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set the visibility property of the referenced model. This 
property determines how the model’s geometry is drawn. It can have one of the following values: 

• #none specifies that no polygons are drawn and the model is invisible. 

• #f ront specifies that only those polygons facing the camera are drawn.This method is 
referred to as back face culling and optimizes rendering speed. This is the default setting 
for the property. 

• #back specifies that only those polygons facing away from the camera are drawn. Use this 
setting when you want to draw the inside of a model, or for models which are not drawing 
correctly, possibly because they were imported from a file format that used a different 
handiness value when computing normals. 

• #both specifies that both sides of all polygons are drawn.Use this setting when you want to see 
the plane regardless of the viewing direction, and for models that are not drawing correctly. 

Example 

The following statement shows that the visibility property of the model Monster02 is set to 
#none. The model is invisible. 

put member!"3D").model("Monster02”).vi si bi 1 ity 
-- #none

volume (DVD) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
dvdObjRef. vol ume 

// JavaScript syntax 
dvdObjRef. vol ume; 

Description 

DVD property. Determines the current volume. Read/write. 

The volume must be an integer in the range of 0 (silent) to 100 (full volume).

volume (Member) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
memberObjRef. vol ume 

// JavaScript syntax 
memberObjRef. vol ume; 

Description 

Shockwave Audio (SWA) cast member property; determines the volume of the specified SWA 
streaming cast member. Values range from 0 to 255. 

This property can be tested and set. 

Example 

This statement sets the volume of an SWA streaming cast member to half the possible volume: 

-- Lingo syntax 

member!"SWAfi1e").volume = 128 

// JavaScript syntax 

member!"SWAfi1e").volume = 128; 

volume (Sound Channel) 

Usage 

-- Lingo syntax 
soundChannelObjRef. vol ume 

// JavaScript syntax 
soundChannelObjRef.vo] ume; 

Description 

Sound Channel property; determines the volume of a sound channel. Read/write. 

Sound channels are numbered 1, 2, 3, and so on up to 8. Channels 1 and 2 are the channels that 
appear in the Score. 


1076 Chapter 14: Properties 



The value of the vol ume property ranges from 0 (mute) to 255 (maximum volume). A value of 
255 indicates the full volume set for the machine, as controlled by the Sound object’s soundLevel 
property, and lower values are scaled to that total volume. This property allows several channels to 
have independent settings within the available range. 

The lower the value of the vol ume sound property, the more static or noise you’re likely to hear. 
Using soundLevel may produce less noise, although this property offers less control. 

To see an example of vol ume used in a completed movie, see the Sound Control movie in the 
Learning/Lingo Examples folder inside the Director application folder. 

Example 

This statement sets the volume of sound channel 2 to 130, which is a medium sound level setting: 

-- Lingo syntax 
soundC2).volume = 130 

// JavaScript syntax 
sound(2).volume = 130;

Description 

Sprite property; controls the volume of a digital video movie or Windows Media cast member 
specified by name or number. The values range from 0 to 256. Values of 0 or less mute the sound. 
Values exceeding 256 are loud and introduce considerable distortion. 

Example 

This statement sets the volume of the QuickTime movie playing in sprite channel 7 to 256, 
which is the maximum sound volume: 

-- Lingo syntax 
sprite(7).volume = 256 

// JavaScript syntax 
sprite(7).volume = 256;

Description 

QuickTime VR sprite property; specifies the type of warping performed on a panorama. 
Possible values are #f ul 1 , #parti al , and #none. 

This property can be tested and set. When tested, if the values for the static and motion modes 
differ, the property’s value is the value set for the current mode. When set, the property 
determines the warping for both the static and motion modes. 

Example 

This sets the warpMode of sprite 1 to #full: 

-- Lingo syntax 

sprite(1).warpMode = #f u 11 

// JavaScript syntax 

sprite(1).warpMode = symbol("full");

member( whichCastmember ).model [modelName] .shader.wrapTransform 
member( whichCastmember ).model.shaderlist[ shaderListlndex ].\ 
wrapT ransform 

Description 

3D standard shader property; this property provides access to a transform that modifies the 
texture coordinate mapping for the shader's texture. Rotate this transform to alter how the 
texture is projected onto a model surface. The texture remains unaffected; the transform modifies 
only the orientation of how the shader applies the texture. 

Note: Note: This command only has an effect when the shader's textureModeList is set to is fplanar, 
♦spherical, or fcylindrical. 

Example 

These statements set the transformMode of the shader named "shad2" to #wrapCyl i ndri cal, 
then rotates that cylindrical projection by 90° about the x-axis so that the cylindrical mapping 
wraps around they-axis instead of the z-axis: 

s = member("Scene").shader("shad2")

shader.wrapTransformList[ textureLayerlndex ] 
member! whichCastmember ).model( modelName ).shaderList\ 

[ shaderListlndex ]. wrapTransformListC textureLayerlndex ] 

Description 

3D standard shader property; this property provides access to a transform that modifies the 
texture coordinate mapping of a specified texture layer. Rotate this transform to alter how the 
texture is projected onto model surfaces. The texture itself remains unaffected; the transform 
modifies only the orientation of how the shader applies the texture. 

Note: wrapTransformListftextureLayerlndex] only has an effect when 
textureModeListf textureLayerlndex] is set to #planar, fspherical, or fcylindrical. 

Example 

In this example, line 2 sets the transformMode of the third texture layer of the shader named 
“shad2” to #wrapCyl i ndri cal . Line 3 rotates that cylindrical projection by 90° about the x-axis 
so that the cylindrical mapping wraps around they-axis instead of the z-axis. 

s = member!"Scene").shader!"shad2")

xAxis 


Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .transform.xAxis 

Description 

3D transform property; allows you to get but not set the vector representing the transform’s 
canonical x-axis in transform space. 

Example 

The first line of this example sets the transform of the model ModCylinder to the identity 
transform. The next two lines show that the x-axis of ModCylinder is the vector (1.0000, 0.0000, 
0.0000). This means that the x-axis of ModCylinder is aligned with the x-axis of the world. The 
next line rotates ModCylinder 90° around itsy-axis. This rotates the axes of ModCylinder as well. 
The last two lines show that the x-axis of ModCylinder is now the vector (0.0000, 0.0000, 
-1.0000). This means that the x-axis of ModCylinder now is aligned with the negative z-axis of 
the world. 

member("Engine").model("ModCylinder").transform.identity() 
put member!"Engine").model("ModCylinder").transform.xAxi s 
-- vector! 1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000 )

y (vector) 

Usage 

member ( whichCastmember) . vector.y 
member ( whichCastmember) .vector[2] 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set the y component of a vector. 

Example 

This statement shows the y component of a vector: 

vec = vector(20, 30, 40) 
put vec.y 
-- 30.0000 


yAxis 

Usage 

member ( whichCastmember) . transform.yAxis 

Description 

3D transform property; allows you to get but not set the vector representing the transform’s 
canonical j-axis in transform space. 


1088 Chapter 14: Properties 



Example 

The first line of this example sets the transform of the model ModCylinder to the identity 
transform. The next two lines show that the Y axis of ModCylinder is the vector (0.0000, 1.0000, 
0.0000). This means that they-axis of ModCylinder is aligned with they-axis of the world. The 
next line rotates ModCylinder 90° around its x-axis. This rotates the axes of ModCylinder as well. 
The last two lines show that they-axis ofModCylinder is now the vector (0.0000, 0.0000, 1.0000). 
This means that they-axis of ModCylinder now is aligned with the positive z-axis of the world. 

member("Engine").model("ModCylinder").transform.identity() 
put member("Engine").model("ModCylinder").transform.yAxis 
-- vector! 0.0000, 1.0000, 0.0000 ) 

member("Engine").model("ModCyl inder").rotate( 90 , 0, 0) 
put member!"Engine").model("ModCylinder").transform.yAxis 
-- vector! 0.0000, 0.0000, 1.0000 ) 


yon 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .camera !whi chCamera ).yon 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set the distance from the camera defining where along the 
camera’s Z axis the view frustum is clipped. Objects at a distance greater than yon are not drawn. 

The default value for this property is 3.40282346638529e38. 

Example 

This statement sets the yon property of camera 1 to 50000: 
member("3d world").camera[1].yon = 50000

z (vector) 

Usage 

member! whichCastmember) .vector. z 
member! whichCastmember) ,vector[3] 

Description 

3D property; allows you to get or set the z component of a vector. 

Example 

This statement shows the z component of a vector: 

vec = vector(20, 30, 40) 
put vec.z 
-- 40.0000 


z (vector) 1089 



zAxis 


Usage 

member( whichCastmember) .transform.zAxis 

Description 

3D transform property; allows you to get but not set the vector representing the transform’s 
canonical z-axis in transform space. 

Example 

The first line of this example sets the transform of the model ModCylinder to the identity 
transform. The next two lines show that the z-axis of ModCylinder is the vector (0.0000, 0.0000, 
1.0000). This means that the z-axis of ModCylinder is aligned with the z-axis of the world. The 
next line rotates ModCylinder 90° around its y-axis. This rotates the axes of ModCylinder as well. 
The last two lines show that the z-axis of ModCylinder is now the vector (1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000). 
This means that the z-axis of ModCylinder now is aligned with the x-axis of the world. 

member!"Engine").model("ModCylinder").transform.identity() 
put member!"Engine").model("ModCylinder").transform.zAxis 
-- vector! 1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000 ) 

member("Engine").model("ModCylinder").rotate!0, 90, 0) 
put member!"Engine").model("ModCylinder").transform.zAxis 
-- vector! 0.0000, 0.0000, -1.0000 )
